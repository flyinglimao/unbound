                世界の男、貴なるも賤しきも、「いかでこのかぐや姫を得てしがな、見てしがな。」と、音に聞きめでて惑ふ。その傍の垣にも家のとにも居る人だに、容易く見るまじきものを、夜は安きいもねず、闇の夜に出でても穴を抉り、こゝかしこより覗き垣間見惑ひあへり。さる時よりなんよばひとはいひける。人の物ともせぬ處に惑ひありけども、何の効あるべくも見えず。家の人どもに物をだに言はんとていひかくれども、ことゝもせず。傍を離れぬ公達、夜を明し日を暮す人多かり。愚なる人は、「益なき歩行はよしなかりけり。」とて、來ずなりにけり。その中に猶いひけるは、色好といはるゝかぎり五人、思ひ止む時なく夜晝來けり。その名一人は石作皇子、一人は車持皇子、一人は右大臣阿倍御主人、一人は大納言大伴御行、一人は中納言石上麿呂、たゞこの人々なりけり。世の中に多かる人をだに、少しもかたちよしと聞きては、見まほしうする人々なりければ、かぐや姫を見まほしうして、物も食はず思ひつゝ、かの家に行きてたたずみありきけれども、かひあるべくもあらず。文を書きてやれども、返事もせず、わび歌など書きて遣れども、かへしもせず。「かひなし。」と思へども、十一月十二月のふりこほり、六月の照りはたゝくにもさはらず來けり。この人々、或時は竹取を呼びいでて、「娘を我にたべ。」と伏し拜み、手を摩りの給へど、「己がなさぬ子なれば、心にも從はずなんある。」といひて、月日を過す。かゝればこの人々、家に歸りて物を思ひ、祈祷をし、願をたて、思やめんとすれども止むべくもあらず。「さりとも遂に男合せざらんやは。」と思ひて、頼をかけたり。強に志を見えありく。これを見つけて、翁かぐや姫にいふやう、「我子の佛變化の人と申しながら、こゝら大さまで養ひ奉る志疎ならず。翁の申さんこと聞き給ひてんや。」といへば、かぐや姫、「何事をか宣はん事を承らざらん。變化の者にて侍りけん身とも知らず、親とこそ思ひ奉れ。」といへば、翁「嬉しくも宣ふものかな。」といふ。「翁年七十に餘りぬ。今日とも明日とも知らず。この世の人は、男は女にあふことをす。女は男に合ふことをす。その後なん門も廣くなり侍る。いかでかさる事なくてはおはしまさん。」かぐや姫のいはく、「なでふさることかしはべらん。」といへば、「變化の人といふとも、女の身もち給へり。翁のあらん限は、かうてもいますかりなんかし。この人々の年月を經て、かうのみいましつつ、宣ふことを思ひ定めて、一人々々にあひ奉り給ひね。」といへば、かぐや姫いはく、「よくもあらぬ容を、深き心も知らで、『あだ心つきなば、後悔しきこともあるべきを。』と思ふばかりなり。世のかしこき人なりとも、深き志を知らでは、あひ難しとなん思ふ。」といふ。翁いはく、「思の如くものたまふかな。そも＼／いかやうなる志あらん人にかあはんと思す。かばかり志疎ならぬ人々にこそあンめれ。」かぐや姫のいはく、「何ばかりの深きをか見んといはん。いさゝかのことなり。人の志ひとしかンなり。いかでか中に劣勝は知らん。「五人の中にゆかしき物見せ給へらんに、「御志勝りたり。」とて仕うまつらん。』と、そのおはすらん人々に申し給へ。」といふ。「よきことなり。」とうけつ。日暮るゝほど、例の集りぬ。人々或は笛を吹き、或は歌をうたひ、或は唱歌をし、或はうそを吹き、扇をならしなどするに、翁出でていはく、「辱くもきたなげなる所に、年月を經て物し給ふこと、極まりたるかしこまりを申す。 『翁の命今日明日とも知らぬを、かくのたまふ君達にも、よく思ひ定めて仕うまつれ。』と申せば、『深き御心をしらでは』となん申す。さ申すも理なり。『いづれ劣勝おはしまさねば、ゆかしきもの見せ給へらんに、御志のほどは見ゆべし。仕うまつらんことは、それになむ定むべき。』といふ。これ善きことなり。人の恨もあるまじ。」といへば、五人の人々も「よきことなり。」といへば、翁入りていふ。かぐや姫、石作皇子には、「天竺に佛の御石の鉢といふものあり。それをとりて給へ。」といふ。車持皇子には、「東の海に蓬莱といふ山あンなり。それに白銀を根とし、黄金を莖とし、白玉を實としてたてる木あり。それ一枝折りて給はらん。」といふ。今一人には、「唐土にある、火鼠の裘を給へ。」大伴大納言には、「龍の首に五色に光る玉あり。それをとりて給へ。」石上中納言には、「燕のもたる子安貝一つとりて給へ。」といふ。翁「難きことゞもにこそあンなれ。この國にある物にもあらず。かく難き事をばいかに申さん。」といふ。かぐや姫、「何か難からん。」といへば、翁、「とまれかくまれ申さん。」とて、出でて「かくなん、聞ゆるやうに見せ給へ。」といへば、皇子達上達部聞きて、「おいらかに、『あたりよりだになありきそ。』とやは宣はぬ。」といひて、うんじて皆歸りぬ。
                
                「猶この女見では、世にあるまじき心ちのしければ、天竺にあるものも持てこぬものかは。」と、思ひめぐらして、石作皇子は心のしたくみある人にて、「天竺に二つとなき鉢を、百千萬里の程行きたりともいかでか取るべき。」と思ひて、かぐや姫の許には、「今日なん天竺へ石の鉢とりにまかる。」と聞かせて、三年ばかり經て、大和國十市郡にある山寺に、賓頭盧の前なる鉢のひた黑に煤つきたるをとりて、錦の袋に入れて、作花の枝につけて、かぐや姫の家にもて來て見せければ、かぐや姫あやしがりて見るに、鉢の中に文あり。ひろげて見れば、
                
                海山のみちにこゝろをつくしはてみいしの鉢のなみだながれき

                かぐや姫、「光やある。」と見るに、螢ばかりのひかりだになし。

                とてかへしいだすを、鉢を門に棄てゝ、この歌のかへしをす。

                しら山にあへば光のうするかとはちを棄てゝもたのまるゝかな

                とよみて入れたり。かぐや姫返しもせずなりぬ。耳にも聞き入れざりければ、いひ煩ひて歸りぬ。かれ鉢を棄てゝまたいひけるよりぞ、面なき事をばはぢをすつとはいひける。
                
                車持皇子は心たばかりある人にて、公には、「筑紫の國に湯あみに罷らん。」とて、暇申して、かぐや姫の家には、「玉の枝とりになんまかる。」といはせて下り給ふに、仕うまつるべき人々、皆難波まで御おくりしけり。皇子「いと忍びて。」と宣はせて、人も數多率ておはしまさず、近う仕うまつる限して出で給ひぬ。御おくりの人々、見奉り送りて歸りぬ。「おはしましぬ。」と人には見え給ひて、三日許ありて漕ぎ歸り給ひぬ。かねて事皆仰せたりければ、その時一の工匠なりける内匠六人を召しとりて、容易く人よりくまじき家を作りて、構を三重にしこめて、工匠等を入れ給ひつゝ、皇子も同じ所に籠り給ひて、しらせ給ひつるかぎり十六そをかみにくどをあけて、玉の枝をつくり給ふ。かぐや姫のたまふやうに、違はずつくり出でつ。いとかしこくたばかりて、難波に密にもて出でぬ。「船に乘りて歸り來にけり。」と、殿に告げやりて、いといたく苦しげなるさまして居給へり。迎に人多く參りたり。玉の枝をば長櫃に入れて、物覆ひてもちて參る。いつか聞きけん、「車持皇子は、優曇華の花持ちて上り給へり。」とのゝしりけり。これをかぐや姫聞きて、「我はこの皇子にまけぬべし。」と、胸つぶれて思ひけり。かゝるほどに門を叩きて、「車持皇子おはしたり。」と告ぐ。「旅の御姿ながらおはしましたり。」といへば、逢ひ奉る。皇子のたまはく、「『命を捨てゝかの玉の枝持てきたり。』とて、かぐや姫に見せ奉り給へ。」といへば、翁もちて入りたり。この玉の枝に文をぞつけたりける。
                
                いたづらに身はなしつとも玉の枝を手をらでさらに歸らざらまし
                
                これをもあはれと見て居るに、竹取の翁走り入りていはく、「この皇子に申し給ひし蓬莱の玉の枝を、一つの所もあやしき處なく、あやまたずもておはしませり。何をもちてか、とかく申すべきにあらず。旅の御姿ながら、我御家へも寄り給はずしておはしましたり。はやこの皇子にあひ仕うまつり給へ。」といふに、物もいはず頬杖をつきて、いみじく歎かしげに思ひたり。この皇子「今さら何かといふべからず。」といふまゝに、縁にはひのぼり給ひぬ。翁ことわりに思ふ。「この國に見えぬ玉の枝なり。この度はいかでかいなびまをさん。人ざまもよき人におはす。」などいひ居たり。かぐや姫のいふやう、「親ののたまふことを、ひたぶるにいなび申さんことのいとほしさに、得難きものを、かくあさましくもてくること」をねたく思ひ、翁は閨の内しつらひなどす。翁皇子に申すやう、「いかなる所にかこの木はさぶらひけん。怪しく麗しくめでたきものにも。」と申す。皇子答へての給はく、 「前一昨年の二月の十日頃に、難波より船に乘りて、海中にいでて、行かん方も知らず覺えしかど、『思ふこと成らでは、世の中に生きて何かせん。』と思ひしかば、たゞ空しき風に任せてありく。『命死なばいかゞはせん。生きてあらん限はかくありきて、蓬莱といふらん山に逢ふや。』と、浪にたゞよひ漕ぎありきて、我國の内を離れてありき廻りしに、或時は浪荒れつゝ海の底にも入りぬべく、或時は風につけて知らぬ國にふき寄せられて、鬼のやうなるものいで來て殺さんとしき。或時には來し方行末も知らず、海にまぎれんとしき。或時にはかて盡きて、草の根を食物としき。或時はいはん方なくむくつけなるもの來て、食ひかゝらんとしき。或時には海の貝をとりて、命をつぐ。旅の空に助くべき人もなき所に、いろ＼／の病をして、行方すらも覺えず、船の行くに任せて、海に漂ひて、五百日といふ辰の時許に、海の中に遙に山見ゆ。舟のうちをなんせめて見る。海の上に漂へる山いと大きにてあり。其山の樣高くうるはし。『是や我覓むる山ならん。』と思へど、さすがに畏しく覺えて、山の圍を指し廻らして、二三日許見ありくに、天人の粧したる女、山の中より出で來て、銀の金鋺をもて水を汲みありく。これを見て船よりおりて、『この山の名を何とか申す。』と問ふに、女答へて曰く、『これは蓬莱の山なり。』と答ふ。是を聞くに嬉しき事限なし。この女に、『かく宣ふは誰ぞ。』と問ふ。『我名はほうかんるり。』といひて、ふと山の中に入りぬ。その山を見るに、更に登るべきやうなし。その山のそばつらを廻れば、世の中になき花の木どもたてり。金銀瑠璃色の水流れいでたり。それにはいろ＼／の玉の橋わたせり。そのあたり照り輝く木どもたてり。その中にこのとりて持てまうできたりしは、いとわろかりしかども、『のたまひしに違はましかば。』とて、この花を折りてまうできたるなり。山は限なくおもしろし。世に譬ふべきにあらざりしかど、この枝を折りてしかば、さらに心もとなくて、船に乘りて追風ふきて、四百餘日になんまうで來にし。大願の力にや、難波より昨日なん都にまうで來つる。さらに潮にぬれたる衣をだに脱ぎかへなでなん、まうで來つる。」との給へば、翁聞きて、うち歎きてよめる、
                
                呉竹のよゝのたけとり野山にもさやはわびしきふしをのみ見し
                
                これを皇子聞きて、「こゝらの日頃思ひわび侍りつる心は、今日なんおちゐぬる。」との給ひて、かへし、
                 
                わが袂けふかわければわびしさのちくさのかずも忘られぬべし
                
                との給ふ。かゝるほどに、男ども六人連ねて庭にいできたり。一人の男、文挾に文をはさみてまをす。「作物所の寮のたくみ漢部内麿まをさく、『玉の木を作りて仕うまつりしこと、心を碎きて、千餘日に力を盡したること少からず。しかるに祿いまだ賜はらず。これを賜はり分ちて、けごに賜はせん。』」といひてさゝげたり。竹取の翁、「この工匠等が申すことは何事ぞ。」とかたぶきをり。皇子は我にもあらぬけしきにて、肝消えぬべき心ちして居給へり。これをかぐや姫聞きて、「この奉る文をとれ。」といひて見れば、文に申しけるやう、「皇子の君千餘日賤しき工匠等と諸共に、同じ所に隱れ居給ひて、かしこき玉の枝を作らせ給ひて、『官も賜はらん。』と仰せ給ひき。これをこの頃案ずるに、『御つかひとおはしますべき、かぐや姫の要じ給ふべきなりけり。』と承りて、この宮より賜はらんと申して給はるべきなり。」といふを聞きて、かぐや姫、暮るゝまゝに思ひわびつる心地ゑみ榮えて、翁を呼びとりていふやう、「誠に蓬莱の木かとこそ思ひつれ、かくあさましき虚事にてありければ、はや疾くかへし給へ。」といへば、翁こたふ、「さだかに造らせたるものと聞きつれば、かへさんこといと易し。」とうなづきをり。かぐや姫の心ゆきはてゝ、ありつる歌のかへし、
                 
                まことかと聞きて見つればことの葉を飾れる玉の枝にぞありける

                といひて、玉の枝もかへしつ。竹取の翁さばかり語らひつるが、さすがに覺えて眠りをり。皇子はたつもはした居るもはしたにて居給へり。日の暮れぬればすべ出で給ひぬ。かのうれへせし工匠等をば、かぐや姫呼びすゑて、「嬉しき人どもなり。」といひて、祿いと多くとらせ給ふ。工匠等いみじく喜びて、「思ひつるやうにもあるかな。」といひて、かへる道にて、車持皇子血の流るゝまでちようぜさせ給ふ。祿得しかひもなく皆とり捨てさせ給ひてければ、逃げうせにけり。かくてこの皇子、「一生の恥これに過ぐるはあらじ。女をえずなりぬるのみにあらず、天の下の人の見思はんことの恥かしき事。」との給ひて、たゞ一所深き山へ入り給ひぬ。宮司候ふ人々、皆手を分ちて求め奉れども、御薨もやしたまひけん、え見つけ奉らずなりぬ。皇子の御供に隱し給はんとて、年頃見え給はざりけるなりけり。是をなんたまさかるとはいひ始めける。
                 
                右大臣阿倍御主人は財豐に家廣き人にぞおはしける。その年わたりける唐土船の王卿といふものゝ許に、文を書きて、「火鼠の裘といふなるもの買ひておこせよ。」とて、仕うまつる人の中に心たしかなるを選びて、小野房守といふ人をつけてつかはす。もていたりて、かの浦に居る王卿に金をとらす。王卿文をひろげて見て、返事かく。「火鼠の裘我國になきものなり。おとには聞けどもいまだ見ぬものなり。世にあるものならば、この國にももてまうで來なまし。いと難きあきなひなり。しかれどももし天竺にたまさかにもて渡りなば、もし長者のあたりにとぶらひ求めんに、なきものならば、使に添へて金返し奉らん。」といへり。かの唐土船來けり。小野房守まうで來てまうのぼるといふことを聞きて、あゆみとうする馬をもちて走らせ迎へさせ給ふ時に、馬に乘りて、筑紫よりたゞ七日に上りまうできたり。文を見るにいはく、「火鼠の裘辛うじて、人を出して求めて奉る。今の世にも昔の世にも、この皮は容易くなきものなりけり。昔かしこき天竺のひじり、この國にもて渡りて侍りける、西の山寺にありと聞き及びて、公に申して、辛うじて買ひとりて奉る。價の金少しと、國司使に申しゝかば、王卿が物加へて買ひたり。今金五十兩たまはるべし。船の歸らんにつけてたび送れ。もし金賜はぬものならば、裘の質かへしたべ。」といへることを見て、「何おほす。今金少しのことにこそあンなれ。必ず送るべき物にこそあンなれ。嬉しくしておこせたるかな。」とて、唐土の方に向ひて伏し拜み給ふ。この裘入れたる箱を見れば、種々のうるはしき瑠璃をいろへて作れり。裘を見れば紺青の色なり。毛の末には金の光輝きたり。げに寳と見え、うるはしきこと比ぶべきものなし。火に燒けぬことよりも、清らなることならびなし。「むべかぐや姫のこのもしがり給ふにこそありけれ。」との給ひて、「あなかしこ。」とて、箱に入れ給ひて、物の枝につけて、御身の假粧いといたくして、やがてとまりなんものぞとおぼして、歌よみ加へて持ちていましたり。その歌は、
                
                かぎりなきおもひに燒けぬかはごろも袂かわきて今日こそはきめ

                家の門にもて至りて立てり。竹取いで來てとり入れて、かぐや姫に見す。かぐや姫かの裘を見ていはく、「うるはしき皮なンめり。わきてまことの皮ならんとも知らず。」竹取答へていはく、「とまれかくまれまづ請じ入れ奉らん。世の中に見えぬ裘のさまなれば、是をまことゝ思ひ給ひね。人ないたくわびさせ給ひそ。」といひて、呼びすゑたてまつれり。かく呼びすゑて、「この度は必ずあはん。」と、嫗の心にも思ひをり。この翁は、かぐや姫のやもめなるを歎かしければ、「よき人にあはせん。」と思ひはかれども、切に「否。」といふことなれば、えしひぬはことわりなり。かぐや姫翁にいはく、「この裘は火に燒かんに、燒けずはこそ實ならめと思ひて、人のいふことにもまけめ。『世になきものなれば、それを實と疑なく思はん。』との給ひて、なほこれを燒きて見ん。」といふ。翁「それさもいはれたり。」といひて、大臣に「かくなん申す。」といふ。大臣答へていはく、「この皮は唐土にもなかりけるを、辛うじて求め尋ね得たるなり。何の疑かあらん。さは申すとも、はや燒きて見給へ。」といへば、火の中にうちくべて燒かせ給ふに、めら＼／と燒けぬ。「さればこそ異物の皮なりけり。」といふ。大臣これを見給ひて、御顔は草の葉の色して居給へり。かぐや姫は「あなうれし。」と喜びて居たり。かのよみ給へる歌のかへし、箱に入れてかへす。

                とぞありける。されば歸りいましにけり。世の人々、「安倍大臣は火鼠の裘をもていまして、かぐや姫にすみ給ふとな。こゝにやいます。」など問ふ。或人のいはく、「裘は火にくべて燒きたりしかば、めら＼／と燒けにしかば、かぐや姫逢ひ給はず。」といひければ、これを聞きてぞ、とげなきものをばあへなしとはいひける。
                
                大伴御行の大納言は、我家にありとある人を召し集めての給はく、「龍の首に五色の光ある玉あンなり。それをとり奉りたらん人には、願はんことをかなへん。」との給ふ。男ども仰の事を承りて申さく、「仰のことはいとも尊し。たゞしこの玉容易くえとらじを、况や龍の首の玉はいかゞとらん。」と申しあへり。大納言のたまふ、「君の使といはんものは、『命を捨てゝも己が君の仰事をばかなへん。』とこそ思ふべけれ。この國になき天竺唐土の物にもあらず、この國の海山より龍はおりのぼるものなり。いかに思ひてか汝等難きものと申すべき。」男ども申すやう、「さらばいかゞはせん。難きものなりとも、仰事に從ひてもとめにまからん。」と申す。大納言見笑ひて、「汝等君の使と名を流しつ。君の仰事をばいかゞは背くべき。」との給ひて、龍の首の玉とりにとて出したて給ふ。この人々の道の糧・食物に、殿のうちの絹・綿・錢などあるかぎりとり出でそへて遣はす。この人々ども、歸るまでいもひをして「我は居らん。この玉とり得では家に歸りくな。」との給はせけり。「おの＼／仰承りて罷りいでぬ。龍の首の玉とり得ずは歸りくな。」との給へば、いづちも＼／足のむきたらんかたへいなんとす。かゝるすき事をし給ふことゝそしりあへり。賜はせたる物はおの＼／分けつゝとり、或は己が家にこもりゐ、或はおのがゆかまほしき所へいぬ。「親・君と申すとも、かくつきなきことを仰せ給ふこと。」と、ことゆかぬものゆゑ、大納言を謗りあひたり。「かぐや姫すゑんには、例のやうには見にくし。」との給ひて、麗しき屋をつくり給ひて、漆を塗り、蒔繪をし、いろへしたまひて、屋の上には糸を染めていろ＼／に葺かせて、内々のしつらひには、いふべくもあらぬ綾織物に繪を書きて、間ごとにはりたり。もとの妻どもは去りて、「かぐや姫を必ずあはん。」とまうけして、獨明し暮したまふ。遣しゝ人は夜晝待ち給ふに、年越ゆるまで音もせず、心もとながりて、いと忍びて、たゞ舍人二人召繼としてやつれ給ひて、難波の邊におはしまして、問ひ給ふことは、「大伴大納言の人や、船に乘りて龍殺して、そが首の玉とれるとや聞く。」と問はするに、船人答へていはく、「怪しきことかな。」と笑ひて、「さるわざする船もなし。」と答ふるに、「をぢなきことする船人にもあるかな。え知らでかくいふ。」とおぼして、「我弓の力は、龍あらばふと射殺して首の玉はとりてん。遲く來るやつばらを待たじ。」との給ひて、船に乘りて、海ごとにありき給ふに、いと遠くて、筑紫の方の海に漕ぎいで給ひぬ。いかゞしけん、はやき風吹きて、世界くらがりて、船を吹きもてありく。いづれの方とも知らず、船を海中にまかり入りぬべくふき廻して、浪は船にうちかけつゝまき入れ、神は落ちかゝるやうに閃きかゝるに、大納言は惑ひて、「まだかゝるわびしきめハ見ず。いかならんとするぞ。」との給ふ。楫取答へてまをす、「こゝら船に乘りてまかりありくに、まだかくわびしきめを見ず。御船海の底に入らずは神落ちかゝりぬべし。もしさいはひに神の助けあらば、南海にふかれおはしぬべし。うたてある主の御許に仕へ奉りて、すゞろなる死をすべかンめるかな。」とて、楫取なく。大納言これを聞きての給はく、「船に乘りては楫取の申すことをこそ高き山ともたのめ。などかくたのもしげなきことを申すぞ。」と、あをへどをつきての給ふ。楫取答へてまをす、「神ならねば何業をか仕らん。風吹き浪はげしけれども、神さへいたゞきに落ちかゝるやうなるは、龍を殺さんと求め給ひさぶらへばかくあンなり。はやても龍の吹かするなり。はや神に祈り給へ。」といへば、「よきことなり。」とて、「楫取の御神聞しめせ。をぢなく心幼く龍を殺さんと思ひけり。今より後は毛一筋をだに動し奉らじ。」と、祝詞をはなちて、立居なく＼／呼ばひ給ふこと、千度ばかり申し給ふけにやあらん、やう＼／神なりやみぬ。少しあかりて、風はなほはやく吹く。 楫取のいはく、「これは龍のしわざにこそありけれ。この吹く風はよき方の風なり。あしき方の風にはあらず。よき方に赴きて吹くなり。」といへども、大納言は是を聞き入れ給はず。三四日ありて吹き返しよせたり。濱を見れば、播磨の明石の濱なりけり。大納言「南海の濱に吹き寄せられたるにやあらん。」と思ひて、息つき伏し給へり。船にある男ども國に告げたれば、國の司まうで訪ふにも、えおきあがり給はで、船底にふし給へり。松原に御筵敷きておろし奉る。その時にぞ「南海にあらざりけり。」と思ひて、辛うじて起き上り給へるを見れば、風いとおもき人にて、腹いとふくれ、こなたかなたの目には、李を二つつけたるやうなり。これを見奉りてぞ、國の司もほゝゑみたる。國に仰せ給ひて、腰輿作らせたまひて、によぶ＼／になはれて家に入り給ひぬるを、いかで聞きけん、遣しゝ男ども參りて申すやう、「龍の首の玉をえとらざりしかばなん、殿へもえ參らざりし。『玉のとり難かりしことを知り給へればなん、勘當あらじ。』とて參りつる。」と申す。大納言起き出でての給はく、「汝等よくもて來ずなりぬ。龍は鳴神の類にてこそありけれ。それが玉をとらんとて、そこらの人々の害せられなんとしけり。まして龍を捕へたらましかば、またこともなく我は害せられなまし。よく捕へずなりにけり。かぐや姫てふ大盜人のやつが、人を殺さんとするなりけり。家のあたりだに今は通らじ。男どもゝなありきそ。」とて、家に少し殘りたりけるものどもは、龍の玉とらぬものどもにたびつ。これを聞きて、離れ給ひしもとのうへは、腹をきりて笑ひ給ふ。糸をふかせてつくりし屋は、鳶烏の巣に皆咋ひもていにけり。世界の人のいひけるは、「大伴の大納言は、龍の玉やとりておはしたる。」「いなさもあらず。御眼二つに李のやうなる玉をぞ添へていましたる。」といひければ、「あなたへがた。」といひけるよりぞ、世にあはぬ事をば、あなたへがたとはいひ始めける。 
                
                中納言石上麻呂は、家につかはるゝ男どもの許に、「燕の巣くひたらば告げよ。」との給ふを、うけたまはりて、「何の料にかあらん。」と申す。答へての給ふやう、「燕のもたる子安貝とらん料なり。」との給ふ。男ども答へて申す、「燕を數多殺して見るにだにも、腹になきものなり。たゞし子産む時なんいかでかいだすらん、はら＼／と人だに見れば失せぬ。」と申す。又人のまをすやう、「大炊寮の飯炊ぐ屋の棟のつくの穴毎に燕は巣くひ侍り。それにまめならん男どもをゐてまかりて、あぐらをゆひて上げて窺はせんに、そこらの燕子うまざらんやは。さてこそとらしめ給はめ。」と申す。中納言喜び給ひて、「をかしき事にもあるかな。もともえ知らざりけり。興あること申したり。」との給ひて、まめなる男ども二十人ばかり遣して、あなゝひに上げすゑられたり。殿より使ひまなく給はせて、「子安貝とりたるか。」と問はせ給ふ。「燕も人の數多のぼり居たるにおぢて、巣にのぼりこず。」かゝるよしの御返事を申しければ、聞き給ひて、「いかゞすべき。」と思しめし煩ふに、かの寮の官人くらつ麿と申す翁申すやう、「子安貝とらんと思しめさば、たばかり申さん。」とて、御前に參りたれば、中納言額を合せてむかひ給へり。くらつ麿が申すやう、「この燕の子安貝は、惡しくたばかりてとらせ給ふなり。さてはえとらせ給はじ。あなゝひにおどろ＼／しく、二十人の人ののぼりて侍れば、あれて寄りまうで來ずなん。せさせ給ふべきやうは、このあななひを毀ちて、人皆退きて、まめならん人一人を荒籠に載せすゑて、綱をかまへて、鳥の子産まん間に綱を釣りあげさせて、ふと子安貝をとらせ給はんなんよかるべき。」と申す。中納言の給ふやう、「いとよきことなり。」とて、あなゝひを毀ちて、人皆歸りまうできぬ。中納言くらつ麿にの給はく、「燕はいかなる時にか子を産むと知りて、人をばあぐべき。」とのたまふ。くらつ麿申すやう、「燕は子うまんとする時は、尾をさゝげて七度廻りてなん産み落すめる。さて七度廻らんをりひき上げて、そのをり子安貝はとらせ給へ。」と申す。中納言喜び給ひて、萬の人にも知らせ給はで、みそかに寮にいまして、男どもの中に交りて、夜を晝になしてとらしめ給ふ。くらつ麿かく申すを、いといたく喜び給ひての給ふ、「こゝに使はるゝ人にもなきに、願をかなふることの嬉しさ。」と宣ひて、御衣ぬぎてかづけ給ひつ。更に「夜さりこの寮にまうでこ。」とのたまひて遣しつ。日暮れぬれば、かの寮におはして見給ふに、誠に燕巣作れり。くらつ麿申すやうに、尾をさゝげて廻るに、荒籠に人を載せて釣りあげさせて、燕の巣に手をさし入れさせて探るに、「物もなし。」と申すに、中納言「惡しく探ればなきなり。」と腹だちて、「誰ばかりおぼえんに。」とて、「我のぼりて探らん。」とのたまひて、籠にのりてつられ登りて窺ひ給へるに、燕尾をさゝげていたく廻るに合せて、手を捧げて探り給ふに、手にひらめるものさはる時に、「われ物握りたり。今はおろしてよ。翁しえたり。」との給ひて、集りて「疾くおろさん。」とて、綱をひきすぐして、綱絶ゆる、即やしまの鼎の上にのけざまに落ち給へり。人々あさましがりて、寄りて抱へ奉れり。御目はしらめにてふし給へり。人々御口に水を掬ひ入れ奉る。辛うじて息いで給へるに、また鼎の上より、手とり足とりしてさげおろし奉る。辛うじて「御心地はいかゞおぼさるゝ。」と問へば、息の下にて、「ものは少し覺ゆれど腰なん動かれぬ。されど子安貝をふと握りもたれば嬉しく覺ゆるなり。まづ脂燭さしてこ。この貝顔みん。」と、御ぐしもたげて御手をひろげ給へるに、燕のまりおける古糞を握り給へるなりけり。それを見給ひて、「あなかひなのわざや。」との給ひけるよりぞ、思ふに違ふことをば、かひなしとはいひける。「かひにもあらず。」と見給ひけるに、御こゝちも違ひて、唐櫃の蓋に入れられ給ふべくもあらず、御腰は折れにけり。中納言はいはけたるわざして、病むことを人に聞かせじとし給ひけれど、それを病にていと弱くなり給ひにけり。 貝をえとらずなりにけるよりも、人の聞き笑はんことを、日にそへて思ひ給ひければ、たゞに病み死ぬるよりも、人ぎき恥しく覺え給ふなりけり。これをかぐや姫聞きてとぶらひにやる歌、
                
                年を經て浪立ちよらぬすみのえのまつかひなしと聞くはまことか
                
                とあるをよみて聞かす。いと弱き心地に頭もたげて、人に紙もたせて、苦しき心地に辛うじてかき給ふ。
                
                かひはかくありけるものをわびはてゝ死ぬる命をすくひやはせぬ
                
                と書きはてゝ絶え入り給ひぬ。これを聞きて、かぐや姫少し哀とおぼしけり。それよりなん少し嬉しきことをば、かひありとはいひける。
                 
                さてかぐや姫かたち世に似ずめでたきことを、帝聞しめして、内侍中臣のふさ子にの給ふ、「多くの人の身を徒になしてあはざンなるかぐや姫は、いかばかりの女ぞ。」と、「罷りて見て參れ。」との給ふ。ふさ子承りてまかれり。竹取の家に畏まりて請じ入れてあへり。嫗に内侍のたまふ、「仰ごとに、かぐや姫の容いうにおはすとなり。能く見て參るべきよしの給はせつるになん參りつる。」といへば、「さらばかくと申し侍らん。」といひて入りぬ。かぐや姫に、「はやかの御使に對面し給へ。」といへば、かぐや姫、「よき容にもあらず。いかでか見ゆべき。」といへば、「うたてもの給ふかな。帝の御使をばいかでか疎にせん。」といへば、かぐや姫答ふるやう、「帝の召しての給はんことかしこしとも思はず。」といひて、更に見ゆべくもあらず。うめる子のやうにはあれど、いと心恥しげに疎なるやうにいひければ、心のまゝにもえ責めず。嫗、内侍の許にかへり出でて、「口をしくこの幼き者はこはく侍るものにて、對面すまじき。」と申す。内侍、「『必ず見奉りて參れ。』と、仰事ありつるものを、見奉らではいかでか歸り參らん。國王の仰事を、まさに世に住み給はん人の承り給はではありなんや。いはれぬことなし給ひそ。」と、詞はづかしくいひければ、これを聞きて、ましてかぐや姫きくべくもあらず。「國王の仰事を背かばはや殺し給ひてよかし。」といふ。この内侍歸り參りて、このよしを奏す。帝聞しめして、「多くの人を殺してける心ぞかし。」との給ひて、止みにけれど、猶思しおはしまして、「この女のたばかりにやまけん。」と思しめして、竹取の翁を召して仰せたまふ、「汝が持て侍るかぐや姫を奉れ。顔容よしと聞しめして、御使をたびしかど、かひなく見えずなりにけり。かくたい＼〃／しくやはならはすべき。」と仰せらる。翁畏まりて御返事申すやう、「この女の童は、絶えて宮仕つかう奉るべくもあらず侍るを、もてわづらひ侍り。さりとも罷りて仰せ給はん。」と奏す。是を聞し召して仰せ給ふやう、「などか翁の手におほしたてたらんものを、心に任せざらん。この女もし奉りたるものならば、翁に冠をなどかたばせざらん。」翁喜びて家に歸りて、かぐや姫にかたらふやう、「かくなん帝の仰せ給へる。なほやは仕う奉り給はぬ。」といへば、かぐや姫答へて曰く、「もはらさやうの宮仕つかう奉らじと思ふを、強ひて仕う奉らせ給はゞ消え失せなん。御司冠つかう奉りて死ぬばかりなり。」翁いらふるやう、「なしたまひそ。官冠も、我子を見奉らでは何にかはせん。さはありともなどか宮仕をし給はざらん。死に給ふやうやはあるべき。」といふ。「『なほそらごとか。』と、仕う奉らせて死なずやあると見給へ。數多の人の志疎ならざりしを、空しくなしてしこそあれ、昨日今日帝のの給はんことにつかん、人ぎきやさし。」といへば、翁答へて曰く、「天の下の事はとありともかゝりとも、御命の危きこそ大なるさはりなれ。猶仕う奉るまじきことを參りて申さん。」とて、參りて申すやう、「仰の事のかしこさに、かの童を參らせんとて仕う奉れば、『宮仕に出したてなば死ぬべし。』とまをす。造麿が手にうませたる子にてもあらず、昔山にて見つけたる。かゝれば心ばせも世の人に似ずぞ侍る。」と奏せさす。 帝おほせ給はく、「造麿が家は山本近かンなり。御狩の行幸し給はんやうにて見てんや。」とのたまはす。造麿が申すやう、「いとよきことなり。何か心もなくて侍らんに、ふと行幸して御覽ぜられなん。」と奏すれば、帝俄に日を定めて、御狩にいで給ひて、かぐや姫の家に入り給ひて見給ふに、光滿ちてけうらにて居たる人あり。「これならん。」とおぼして、近くよらせ給ふに、逃げて入る、袖を捕へ給へば、おもてをふたぎて候へど、初よく御覽じつれば、類なくおぼえさせ給ひて、「許さじとす。」とて率ておはしまさんとするに、かぐや姫答へて奏す、「おのが身はこの國に生れて侍らばこそ仕へ給はめ、いとゐておはし難くや侍らん。」と奏す。帝「などかさあらん。猶率ておはしまさん。」とて、御輿を寄せたまふに、このかぐや姫きと影になりぬ。「はかなく、口をし。」とおぼして、「げにたゞ人にはあらざりけり。」とおぼして、「さらば御供には率ていかじ。もとの御かたちとなり給ひね。それを見てだに歸りなん。」と仰せらるれば、かぐや姫もとのかたちになりぬ。帝なほめでたく思し召さるゝことせきとめがたし。かく見せつる造麿を悦びたまふ。さて仕うまつる百官の人々に、あるじいかめしう仕う奉る。帝かぐや姫を留めて歸り給はんことを、飽かず口をしくおぼしけれど、たましひを留めたる心地してなん歸らせ給ひける。御輿に奉りて後に、かぐや姫に、
                
                かへるさのみゆき物うくおもほえてそむきてとまるかぐや姫ゆゑ
                
                御返事を、
                
                葎はふ下にもとしは經ぬる身のなにかはたまのうてなをもみむ
                
                これを帝御覽じて、いとゞ歸り給はんそらもなくおぼさる。御心は更に立ち歸るべくもおぼされざりけれど、さりとて夜を明し給ふべきにもあらねば、歸らせ給ひぬ。常に仕う奉る人を見給ふに、かぐや姫の傍に寄るべくだにあらざりけり。「こと人よりはけうらなり。」とおぼしける人の、かれに思しあはすれば人にもあらず。かぐや姫のみ御心にかゝりて、たゞ一人過したまふ。よしなくて御方々にもわたり給はず、かぐや姫の御許にぞ御文を書きて通はさせ給ふ。御返事さすがに憎からず聞えかはし給ひて、おもしろき木草につけても、御歌を詠みてつかはす。
                 
                かやうにて、御心を互に慰め給ふほどに、三年ばかりありて、春の初より、かぐや姫月のおもしろう出でたるを見て、常よりも物思ひたるさまなり。ある人の「月の顔見るは忌むこと。」ゝ制しけれども、ともすればひとまには月を見ていみじく泣き給ふ。七月のもちの月にいで居て、切に物思へるけしきなり。近く使はるゝ人々、竹取の翁に告げていはく、「かぐや姫例も月をあはれがり給ひけれども、この頃となりてはたゞ事にも侍らざンめり。いみじく思し歎くことあるべし。よく＼／見奉らせ給へ。」といふを聞きて、かぐや姫にいふやう、「なでふ心ちすれば、かく物を思ひたるさまにて月を見給ふぞ。うましき世に。」といふ。かぐや姫、「月を見れば世の中こゝろぼそくあはれに侍り。なでふ物をか歎き侍るべき。」といふ。かぐや姫のある所に至りて見れば、なほ物思へるけしきなり。これを見て、「あが佛何事を思ひ給ふぞ。思すらんこと何事ぞ。」といへば、「思ふこともなし。物なん心細く覺ゆる。」といへば、翁、「月な見給ひそ。これを見給へば物思すけしきはあるぞ。」といへば、「いかでか月を見ずにはあらん。」とて、なほ月出づれば、いで居つゝ歎き思へり。夕暗には物思はぬ氣色なり。月の程になりぬれば、猶時々はうち歎きなきなどす。是をつかふものども、「猶物思すことあるべし。」とさゝやけど、親を始めて何事とも知らず。八月十五日ばかりの月にいで居て、かぐや姫いといたく泣き給ふ。人めも今はつゝみ給はず泣き給ふ。これを見て、親どもゝ「何事ぞ。」と問ひさわぐ。かぐや姫なく＼／いふ、「さき＼／も申さんと思ひしかども、『かならず心惑はし給はんものぞ。』と思ひて、今まで過し侍りつるなり。『さのみやは。』とてうち出で侍りぬるぞ。おのが身はこの國の人にもあらず、月の都の人なり。それを昔の契なりけるによりてなん、この世界にはまうで來りける。今は歸るべきになりにければ、この月の十五日に、かのもとの國より迎に人々まうでこんず。さらずまかりぬべければ、思し歎かんが悲しきことを、この春より思ひ歎き侍るなり。」といひて、いみじく泣く。翁「こはなでふことをの給ふぞ。竹の中より見つけきこえたりしかど、菜種の大さおはせしを、我丈たち並ぶまで養ひ奉りたる我子を、何人か迎へ聞えん。まさに許さんや。」といひて、「我こそ死なめ。」とて、泣きのゝしることいと堪へがたげなり。かぐや姫のいはく、「月の都の人にて父母あり。片時の間とてかの國よりまうでこしかども、かくこの國には數多の年を經ぬるになんありける。かの國の父母の事もおぼえず。こゝにはかく久しく遊び聞えてならひ奉れり。いみじからん心地もせず、悲しくのみなんある。されど己が心ならず罷りなんとする。」といひて、諸共にいみじう泣く。つかはるゝ人々も年頃ならひて、立ち別れなんことを、心ばへなどあてやかに美しかりつることを見ならひて、戀しからんことの堪へがたく、湯水も飮まれず、同じ心に歎しがりけり。この事を帝きこしめして、竹取が家に御使つかはさせ給ふ。御使に竹取いで逢ひて、泣くこと限なし。この事を歎くに、髪も白く腰も屈り目もたゞれにけり。翁今年は五十許なりけれども、「物思には片時になん老になりにける。」と見ゆ。御使仰事とて翁にいはく、「いと心苦しく物思ふなるは、誠にか。」と仰せ給ふ。竹取なく＼／申す、「このもちになん、月の都よりかぐや姫の迎にまうでくなる。たふとく問はせ給ふ。このもちには人々たまはりて、月の都の人まうで來ば捕へさせん。」と申す。御使かへり參りて、翁のありさま申して、奏しつる事ども申すを聞し召しての給ふ、「一目見給ひし御心にだに忘れ給はぬに、明暮見馴れたるかぐや姫をやりてはいかゞ思ふべき。」かの十五日司々に仰せて、勅使には少將高野大國といふ人をさして、六衞のつかさ合せて、二千人の人を竹取が家につかはす。 家に罷りて築地の上に千人、屋の上に千人、家の人々いと多かりけるに合はせて、あける隙もなく守らす。この守る人々も弓矢を帶して居り。母屋の内には女どもを番にすゑて守らす。嫗塗籠の内にかぐや姫を抱きて居り。翁も塗籠の戸をさして戸口に居り。翁のいはく、「かばかり守る所に、天の人にもまけんや。」といひて、屋の上に居る人々に曰く、「つゆも物空にかけらばふと射殺し給へ。」守る人々のいはく、「かばかりして守る所に、蝙蝠一つだにあらば、まづ射殺して外にさらさんと思ひ侍る。」といふ。翁これを聞きて、たのもしがり居り。これを聞きてかぐや姫は、「鎖し籠めて守り戰ふべきしたくみをしたりとも、あの國の人をえ戰はぬなり。弓矢して射られじ。かくさしこめてありとも、かの國の人こば皆あきなんとす。相戰はんとすとも、かの國の人來なば、猛き心つかふ人よもあらじ。」翁のいふやう、「御迎へにこん人をば、長き爪して眼をつかみつぶさん。さが髪をとりてかなぐり落さん。さが尻をかき出でて、こゝらのおほやけ人に見せて耻見せん。」と腹だちをり。かぐや姫いはく、「聲高になの給ひそ。屋の上に居る人どもの聞くに、いとまさなし。いますかりつる志どもを、思ひも知らで罷りなんずることの口をしう侍りけり。『長き契のなかりければ、程なく罷りぬべきなンめり。』と思ふが悲しく侍るなり。親たちのかへりみをいさゝかだに仕う奉らで、罷らん道も安くもあるまじきに、月頃もいで居て、今年ばかりの暇を申しつれど、更に許されぬによりてなんかく思ひ歎き侍る。御心をのみ惑はして去りなんことの、悲しく堪へがたく侍るなり。かの都の人はいとけうらにて、老いもせずなん。思ふこともなく侍るなり。さる所へまからんずるもいみじくも侍らず。老い衰へ給へるさまを見奉らざらんこそ戀しからめ。」といひて泣く。翁、「胸痛きことなしたまひそ。麗しき姿したる使にもさはらじ。」とねたみをり。かゝる程に宵うちすぎて、子の時ばかりに、家のあたり晝のあかさにも過ぎて光りたり。望月のあかさを十合せたるばかりにて、ある人の毛の穴さへ見ゆるほどなり。大空より、人雲に乘りておりきて、地より五尺ばかりあがりたる程に立ち連ねたり。これを見て、内外なる人の心ども、物におそはるゝやうにて、相戰はん心もなかりけり。辛うじて思ひ起して、弓矢をとりたてんとすれども、手に力もなくなりて、痿え屈りたる中に、心さかしき者、ねんじて射んとすれども、外ざまへいきければ、あれも戰はで、心地たゞしれにしれて守りあへり。立てる人どもは、裝束の清らなること物にも似ず。飛車一つ具したり。羅蓋さしたり。その中に王とおぼしき人、「家に造麿まうでこ。」といふに、猛く思ひつる造麿も、物に醉ひたる心ちしてうつぶしに伏せり。いはく、「汝をさなき人、聊なる功徳を翁つくりけるによりて、汝が助にとて片時の程とて降しゝを、そこらの年頃そこらの金賜ひて、身をかへたるが如くなりにたり。かぐや姫は、罪をつくり給へりければ、かく賤しきおのれが許にしばしおはしつるなり。罪のかぎりはてぬれば、かく迎ふるを、翁は泣き歎く、あたはぬことなり。はや返し奉れ。」といふ。翁答へて申す、「かぐや姫を養ひ奉ること二十年あまりになりぬ。片時との給ふに怪しくなり侍りぬ。また他處にかぐや姫と申す人ぞおはしますらん。」といふ。「こゝにおはするかぐや姫は、重き病をし給へばえ出でおはしますまじ。」と申せば、その返事はなくて、屋の上に飛車をよせて、「いざかぐや姫、穢き所にいかでか久しくおはせん。」といふ。立て籠めたる所の戸即たゞあきにあきぬ。格子どもゝ人はなくして開きぬ。嫗抱きて居たるかぐや姫外にいでぬ。えとゞむまじければ、たゞさし仰ぎて泣きをり。 竹取心惑ひて泣き伏せる所に寄りて、かぐや姫いふ、「こゝにも心にもあらでかくまかるに、昇らんをだに見送り給へ。」といへども、「何しに悲しきに見送り奉らん。我をばいかにせよとて、棄てゝは昇り給ふぞ。具して率ておはせね。」と、泣きて伏せれば、御心惑ひぬ。「文を書きおきてまからん。戀しからんをり＼／、とり出でて見給へ。」とて、うち泣きて書くことばは、「この國に生れぬるとならば、歎かせ奉らぬ程まで侍るべきを、侍らで過ぎ別れぬること、返す＼〃／本意なくこそ覺え侍れ。脱ぎおく衣をかたみと見給へ。月の出でたらん夜は見おこせ給へ。見すて奉りてまかる空よりもおちぬべき心ちす。」と、かきおく。天人の中にもたせたる箱あり。天の羽衣入れり。又あるは不死の藥入れり。ひとりの天人いふ、「壺なる御藥たてまつれ。きたなき所のもの食しめしたれば、御心地あしからんものぞ。」とて、持てよりたれば、聊甞め給ひて、少しかたみとて、脱ぎおく衣に包まんとすれば、ある天人つゝませず、御衣をとり出でてきせんとす。その時にかぐや姫「しばし待て。」といひて、「衣着つる人は心ことになるなり。物一言いひおくべき事あり。」といひて文かく。天人「おそし。」と心もとながり給ふ。かぐや姫「物知らぬことなの給ひそ。」とて、いみじく靜かにおほやけに御文奉り給ふ。あわてぬさまなり。「かく數多の人をたまひて留めさせ給へど、許さぬ迎まうできて、とり率て罷りぬれば、口をしく悲しきこと、宮仕つかう奉らずなりぬるも、かくわづらはしき身にて侍れば、心得ずおぼしめしつらめども、心強く承らずなりにしこと、なめげなるものに思し召し止められぬるなん、心にとまり侍りぬる。」とて、

                  description:
                    "A tale about Princess Kaguya, who was discovered shining inside bamboo by an old bamboo cutter and raised by him and his wife.",
                  content: `Long ago, there lived a man called the bamboo cutter. He mingled in the mountains and fields, cutting bamboo which he used for various purposes. His name was said to be Sanuki no Miyatsuko. Among the bamboo, there was one stalk that shone at its base. Wondering at this, he approached and looked, and inside the hollow was shining. Looking closely, he saw a beautiful person about three inches tall sitting there. The old man said, "I see you each morning and evening inside the bamboo, so I know you must be meant to be my child." He put her in his hand and brought her home. He entrusted her to his wife to raise. She was limitlessly beautiful. As she was still very young, they raised her in a basket. After the bamboo cutter found this child, whenever he cut bamboo, he would find gold in the bamboo sections. Thus, the old man gradually became wealthy. As they raised this child, she grew quickly. After about three months, she was a fine young woman, so they performed her hair-raising ceremony and dressed her in a formal skirt. They kept her secluded behind screens, raising her with great care. The child's beauty was unmatched in the world, and the interior of the house was filled with light. When the old man felt unwell or in pain, looking at this child would stop his suffering. Even anger was soothed. The bamboo cutter had been cutting bamboo for a long time. He had become a man of great means. When the child had grown considerably, her name was given by summoning the diviner Akita from Mimurodo. He named her Nayotake no Kaguya-hime (Princess Kaguya of the Supple Bamboo). At this time, they celebrated for three days, inviting all manner of people and playing many games. Both men and women were invited, and they celebrated splendidly.

                Men of the world, both noble and humble, heard of her and became entranced, saying, "How I wish I could obtain this Kaguya-hime, how I wish I could see her." Even those who merely sat by the fence or at the gate could not easily see her, so at night, unable to sleep, they would go out in the darkness, bore holes, and peer through from here and there in confusion. From that time on, this was called "courting." Though they were infatuated with a person who cared nothing for them, no benefit could be seen. Though they tried to speak to the household staff, their words were ignored. Many suitors remained near, staying up through the night and spending their days there. Foolish people said, "Fruitless wandering is useless," and stopped coming. But among those who still spoke of her, there were five men in particular, known for their love of beauty, who came night and day without ceasing. Their names were Prince Ishizukuri, Prince Kuramochi, the Right Minister Abe no Miushi, the Grand Counselor Otomo no Miyuki, and the Middle Counselor Isonokami no Marotari. It was only these men. Since these were the kind of people who would want to see even slightly beautiful people that they heard about in the world, they longed to see Kaguya-hime and, thinking of her to the point of not eating, went to that house and stood around, but there was no benefit. Though they wrote letters, they received no replies. Though they sent love poems, there were no responses. Thinking it was hopeless, they nevertheless came through the November and December frost and snow, and the June heat, undeterred. These men sometimes called the bamboo cutter out, prostrated themselves, and rubbed their hands together, saying, "Give me your daughter." But he would say, "She is not my own child, so I cannot control her mind," and the days passed. As this continued, these men returned home and dwelled in thought, performing prayers and making vows, trying to forget her but unable to do so. "But surely in the end she will not remain unmarried," they thought, placing their hopes on this. They showed their strong determination. Seeing this, the old man said to Kaguya-hime, "Though I say you are a divine transformation, I have raised you with no lack of care until you have grown this large. Will you listen to what this old man has to say?" Kaguya-hime replied, "What would you say that I would not obey? Though I didn't know I was a transformed being, I think of you as my father." The old man said, "How delightful your words are. I am over seventy years old. I don't know if today or tomorrow will be my last. In this world, men seek women, and women seek men. Afterwards, one's gate widens. How could you go on without such a thing?" Kaguya-hime said, "Why should there be such a thing?" The old man replied, "Though you say you are a transformed being, you have a woman's body. While I am alive, you can remain as you are. These men have spent months and years here, and if you could decide your thoughts and agree to meet each one individually, that would be good." Kaguya-hime replied, "I fear that if I rashly become attached to someone without knowing their deep hearts, despite my less than beautiful appearance, I might later regret it. Even if they are wise people of the world, without knowing their deep intentions, I think it would be difficult to meet them." The old man said, "Your thoughts are as I expected. What kind of intention would you want to see in a person you would meet? Surely these people who have shown such dedication." Kaguya-hime said, "What deep intention should I look for? It's a small matter. People's intentions are all the same. How can I know which is inferior or superior among them? Tell those gentlemen, 'To whichever one shows me an object of desire, I shall say, "Your intention is superior," and serve him.'" "A good idea," he agreed. As evening fell, they gathered as usual. Some played flutes, some sang songs, some chanted, some whistled, some made sounds with fans, when the old man came out and said, "I express my deepest gratitude for your having come to such a humble place for months and years. She says, 'Since the old man's life is uncertain from day to day, I should decide well and serve one of you gentlemen.' This is what she says. She also says, 'Without knowing your deep hearts.' This too is reasonable. 'Since I cannot tell which of you is inferior or superior, to whichever shows me an object of desire, I shall determine the depth of your intention. That is whom I shall serve.' That's what she says. This is a good thing. No one need be resentful." When the five men said, "This is a good thing," the old man went inside and told her. Kaguya-hime said to Prince Ishizukuri, "There is a begging bowl of the Buddha in India. Please bring that to me." To Prince Kuramochi, she said, "There is a mountain called Horai in the eastern sea. There is a tree there with roots of silver, a trunk of gold, and fruit of white jade. Please break off a branch and bring it to me." To another, she said, "Please bring me the robe of the fire-rat from China." To the Grand Counselor Otomo, she said, "There is a jewel that shines in five colors on the neck of a dragon. Please bring that to me." To the Middle Counselor Isonokami, she said, "Please bring me a cowrie shell from the swallow." The old man said, "These are difficult things indeed. These are not things found in this country. How can I tell them such difficult things?" Kaguya-hime said, "What is difficult about it?" The old man said, "I will tell them regardless." He went out and said, "This is what she says. Please show her as you hear." The princes and nobles heard this and said, "Does she not even say, 'Just bring something from nearby'?" They all groaned and returned home. "Since I cannot bear to live without seeing this woman, could I not bring something from India?" Prince Ishizukuri, being a resourceful person, thought, "How could I go thousands of miles to India and get a bowl that is unique in the world?" He let Kaguya-hime know, "Today I am leaving for India to get the stone bowl," but after about three years, he took a bowl from a mountain temple in Yamato Province in the County of Toichi, which was covered in soot before Binzuru, put it in a brocade bag, attached it to a branch of artificial flowers, and brought it to Kaguya-hime's house to show her. Kaguya-hime looked at it suspiciously, and inside the bowl was a letter. When she unfolded it and read it, it said:

                To the ends of sea and mountain I journeyed with all my heart,
                And shed tears over this stone bowl.

                Kaguya-hime looked to see if it shone, but there was not even the light of a firefly.

                If you had stored even the light of dewdrops,
                Why did you search on Mount Ogura?

                She sent it back, throwing the bowl at the gate and composing a reply to his poem.

                If, approaching White Mountain, the light faded,
                Why throw away the bowl and still hope?

                She wrote this and sent it in. Kaguya-hime did not reply further and did not listen, so he became troubled and returned home. Since he had thrown away the bowl when he spoke again, from that time on, they began to say that an embarrassing thing was "throwing away one's face."

                Prince Kuramochi, being resourceful, announced publicly, "I will go to bathe in the hot springs of Tsukushi Province," and requested leave, but he told Kaguya-hime's household, "I am going to get the jeweled branch." The servants who were to attend him all accompanied him as far as Naniwa. The prince said, "Very secretly," and did not take many people with him, departing only with those who served him closely. Those who had accompanied him to see him off returned. He made it appear to people that he had departed, but after about three days, he paddled back. Since he had already given all his orders, he summoned the six best craftsmen in the realm and had them build a house that ordinary people could not easily approach, with three layers of fences around it. The prince secluded himself in the same place with the craftsmen, and as he had instructed them, they opened a vent for smoke at the top and created a jeweled branch. They made it exactly as Kaguya-hime had described. With great resourcefulness, they secretly brought it out to Naniwa. He sent word to the palace, "I have returned by boat," and sat with a very pained expression. Many people came to welcome him. The jeweled branch was placed in a long chest, covered, and brought along. Somehow the news had spread: "Prince Kuramochi has returned with the flower of the udumbara." People were buzzing about this. When Kaguya-hime heard this, she thought, "I may have to yield to this prince," and felt her chest tightening. At that moment, someone knocked at the gate and announced, "Prince Kuramochi has arrived." "He has come in his travel attire," was the message. She met him. The prince said, "Tell Kaguya-hime, 'I have brought the jeweled branch, risking my life.' Show it to her." The old man took it in. The jeweled branch had a letter attached.

                Though I may have wasted my life, had I not broken off
                This jeweled branch with my hand, I would never have returned.

                Looking at this with emotion, the bamboo cutter ran in and said, "This prince has brought the jeweled branch from Horai as you requested, with not one part of it missing. What more can I say? He came directly to our house without even returning to his own, still in his travel attire. Please quickly agree to serve this prince." But she said nothing, resting her cheek on her hand with a deeply troubled expression. The prince said, "There is nothing more to be said now," and climbed up onto the veranda. The old man thought this was reasonable. "This is a jeweled branch not seen in this country. How could she not be persuaded this time? And he is a fine person." Kaguya-hime said, "Because I am reluctant to stubbornly refuse what my parent says, I find it vexing that such a difficult object has been brought so easily." The old man prepared the inner chamber. The old man said to the prince, "In what place was this tree growing? It is strangely beautiful and splendid." The prince replied, "Around the end of February the year before last, I boarded a ship at Naniwa and went out to sea, not knowing which way to go, but thinking, 'If I cannot fulfill my wish, what use is there in living in this world?' So I entrusted myself to the aimless wind. 'If I die, so be it. As long as I am alive, I will wander like this and perhaps encounter the mountain called Horai.' I floated on the waves and paddled around, leaving our country's shores, and at times the waves were rough, and I nearly sank to the bottom of the sea. At times the wind blew me to unknown countries where monstrous beings came out to kill me. At times I did not know where I was coming from or going to, and was about to be lost at sea. At times I ran out of provisions and ate grass roots for food. At times indescribably horrific beings came to attack me. At times I collected seashells to sustain my life. With no one to help me in that foreign sky, I suffered various illnesses, without even knowing where I was, drifting on the sea at the mercy of the boat, floating on the ocean, and around the five hundredth day, at about the hour of the dragon, a mountain appeared in the distance on the sea. I strained to look from the boat. It was a very large mountain floating on the sea. The mountain was tall and beautiful. I thought, 'This must be the mountain I seek,' but I felt afraid and circled around the mountain for two or three days, when a woman dressed like a celestial being came out from the mountain carrying a silver basin to draw water. Seeing this, I got off the boat and asked, 'What is the name of this mountain?' The woman answered, 'This is Mount Horai.' Hearing this, I felt boundless joy. I asked the woman, 'Who are you?' She said, 'My name is Hokan Ruri,' and suddenly disappeared into the mountain. Looking at that mountain, there seemed to be no way to climb it. Circling around the foot of the mountain, there were trees with flowers not found in this world. Streams of gold, silver, and lapis lazuli flowed out. Bridges of various jewels spanned them. Trees that glowed and sparkled grew in that area. Among them, this one that I have brought back was actually quite inferior, but I thought, 'If I don't bring what she asked for,' so I broke off this flower and brought it back. The mountain is limitlessly beautiful, beyond comparison with anything in the world, but after breaking off this branch, I felt unsettled and boarded the ship, and with a tailwind, I have come back after more than four hundred days. Perhaps by the power of my great wish, I arrived in the capital from Naniwa just yesterday. I have come here without even changing my clothes soaked in seawater." Hearing this, the old man sighed and composed this poem:

                I who have only seen the knotty nodes of the Yoshino bamboo,
                How sad I have been, wandering through fields and mountains.

                Hearing this, the prince said, "My heart, which has been suffering these days, has found relief today," and replied:

                Since my sleeves are fresh today,
                I will be able to forget the number of bitter grasses I endured.

                Meanwhile, six men entered the garden together. One man held a document case with a letter and announced, "I, Takenouchi no Kasamaro, craftsman of the Bureau of Works, say this: 'The making of the jeweled tree that I served you with consumed my heart, and I expended no small effort over more than a thousand days. Yet I have not received my payment. Please grant this and divide it among the men.'" He presented the letter. The bamboo cutter asked, "What is this claim from these craftsmen about?" and inclined his head. The prince sat with an expression that was not himself, feeling as if his liver would dissolve. Hearing this, Kaguya-hime said, "Take this letter," and reading it, the document stated: "His Highness the Prince secluded himself with humble craftsmen for more than a thousand days in the same place, having us create a splendid jeweled branch, and told us, 'I will grant you an official position.' Considering this recently, we have learned that 'This branch is for Princess Kaguya, whom you are to wed.' Please grant us what you promised from this palace." Hearing this, Kaguya-hime's heart, which had been sinking all evening, blossomed in scornful laughter, and she called the old man and said, "I truly thought it might be a branch from Horai, but since it turns out to be such an outrageous lie, please quickly send him away." The old man responded, "Since I have clearly heard that it was made, it is very easy to return it. I agree." With Kaguya-hime's heart fully satisfied, she replied to the previous poem:

                I thought it was real, but when I saw it,
                It was just a jeweled branch decorated with words.

                She returned the jeweled branch as well. The bamboo cutter, who had been speaking so much, fell asleep, embarrassed by the revelation. The prince stood half-sitting, half-standing. When evening came, he had no choice but to leave. Kaguya-hime called the concerned craftsmen, saying, "You are delightful people," and gave them a very generous payment. The craftsmen were extremely pleased, saying, "Things have turned out as we hoped." On the way back, Prince Kuramochi had them beaten until they bled. Although they had received payment, he made them throw it all away, and they ran off. Thus, this prince said, "There is no greater shame in life than this. Not only have I failed to get the woman, but the embarrassment of being seen by people all over the land." He entered a deep mountain alone. Though the palace officials all split up to search for him, perhaps he had died, for they could not find him. It seems that he had hidden himself, intending to accompany the prince, and had not been seen for years. This is what people began to call "scarce."

                The Right Minister Abe no Miushi was a wealthy man with a large household. He wrote a letter to Wang Qing, who had come on a ship from China that year, saying, "Buy me what they call the robe of the fire-rat and send it to me." He selected a trustworthy person from among his servants, a man called Ono no Fusamori, and sent him along with gold. Upon arrival, he gave the gold to Wang Qing on that shore. Wang Qing read the letter and replied: "The robe of the fire-rat is not found in our country. I have heard of it but never seen it. If it existed in the world, it would have been brought to our country. It is a very difficult trade. However, if by chance it is brought over from India, or if I inquire among the wealthy, and if it does not exist, I will return the gold with the messenger." The Chinese ship arrived. Hearing that Ono no Fusamori was coming up to the capital, he sent a horse that could run without stopping to meet him, and he rode up from Tsukushi to the capital in just seven days. Looking at the letter, it said: "With great difficulty, I have sent people out to search for and offer you the robe of the fire-rat. This skin is something that is not easily obtainable, either in the present or past ages. I heard that a holy man from wise India who had come to our country had it in a western mountain temple, and applying to the government, I managed with difficulty to buy it for you. Since the provincial governor's messenger said the price in gold was small, Wang Qing added his own resources to buy it. Now fifty ryo of gold should be granted. Send it back with the returning ship. If you do not grant the gold, please return the robe as collateral." Seeing this, he said, "What do you think? The matter of a little gold is nothing. This is certainly something that should be sent. How delightful that they sent it!" He prostrated himself facing China in gratitude. Looking at the box in which the robe was placed, it was made of various beautiful pieces of lapis lazuli. Looking at the robe, it was an indigo color. The tips of the fur shone with golden light. Indeed, it looked like a treasure, and its beauty was incomparable. The fact that it did not burn in fire made it uniquely clean. "No wonder Kaguya-hime desired it," he said, and reverently placed it back in the box, attached it to a branch, made himself look very sick, and thinking he would stay the night, added a poem and brought it. The poem was:

                This robe, which cannot burn in the limitless passion of fire,
                Today I shall wear it with dry sleeves.

                He stood at the gate of the house. The bamboo cutter came out, took it in, and showed it to Kaguya-hime. Kaguya-hime, looking at the robe, said, "It seems to be a beautiful skin. But I do not know if it is genuine." The bamboo cutter replied, "Anyway, let me first invite him in. Since this is a robe not seen in the world, please consider it genuine. Do not make the person suffer unnecessarily." He invited him in. Having invited him in, "This time we will surely meet," thought the old woman in her heart. This old man was distressed that Kaguya-hime was unmarried, so he thought, "I will match her with a good person," but she firmly refused, so it was natural that he could not force her. Kaguya-hime said to the old man, "I will believe this robe is genuine if it does not burn in fire, and I will yield to what people say. Since it is something not found in the world, I will believe without doubt that it is genuine." She said, "Now I will still burn this and see." The old man said, "That's reasonable," and told the minister, "This is what she says." The minister replied, "This skin was not even found in China, and was sought and obtained with great difficulty. What doubt could there be? But if she says so, go ahead and burn it to see." They threw it into the fire to burn, and it burned with bright flames. "So it really wasn't a special skin," they said. Seeing this, the minister's face turned the color of leaves, while Kaguya-hime sat there delighted, saying, "How wonderful." She put her reply to his poem in the box and returned it.

                If I had known it would burn without a trace,
                I would have looked at the fire-robe apart from my thoughts.

                So he returned home. People in the world asked, "Did Minister Abe bring the fire-rat's robe and marry Kaguya-hime? Is she here?" Some people said, "When the robe was put in the fire, it burned with bright flames, so Kaguya-hime did not meet him." Hearing this, people began to call something that does not bear fruit "fruitless."

                The Grand Counselor Otomo no Miyuki summoned all the men in his household and said, "There is a jewel that shines in five colors on a dragon's head. To anyone who brings me that jewel, I will grant whatever they wish." The men heard his order and said, "Your order is most honorable. However, this jewel will not be easy to obtain, let alone a jewel from a dragon's head." The grand counselor said, "A person who calls himself a lord's messenger should think, 'I will fulfill my lord's order even at the cost of my life.' A dragon rises and descends from seas and mountains in this country. It is not something that is not in this country, nor is it from India or China. How can you say it is difficult?" The men said, "If that is so, what shall we do? Though it is difficult, we will obey your order and go to seek it." The grand counselor laughed and said, "You have called yourselves the lord's messengers. How could you disobey the lord's order?" He sent them out to get the dragon's head jewel. For these men's road provisions and food, he took out all the silk, cotton, and money from the palace and sent them with provisions. He told these men, "I will stay until you return. Do not return home without getting this jewel." When he said, "Each of you has heard my order and gone forth. Do not return without getting the dragon's head jewel," they all intended to go in whatever direction their feet took them. They criticized him for doing such a foolish thing. They divided up what he had given them, some staying secluded in their homes, others going where they wanted to go. Because of this futile command, they slandered the grand counselor among themselves, saying, "Even if he is a parent or lord, to order such an unreasonable thing!" The grand counselor said, "It's not good to see Kaguya-hime in the usual way," so he built a beautiful house, applied lacquer, made designs with sprinkled metal powder, colored it, and covered the roof with dyed threads of various colors. For the interior furnishings, he hung painted silk fabrics on every panel that cannot be described. Having dismissed his former wives, he made preparations, saying, "I will definitely marry Kaguya-hime," and spent his days and nights alone. As he waited day and night for the men he had sent, there was no word of them even after a year passed, and feeling anxious, he secretly disguised himself with just two attendants and went to the area of Naniwa, where he asked, "Have any of Otomo no Daijin's men killed a dragon and taken the jewel from its head?" The boatmen answered, "What a strange thing," laughing, "there are no ships that do such things." Thinking, "What shameless boatmen, not knowing and speaking like this," he said, "With the power of my bow, if there is a dragon, I will shoot and kill it and take the jewel from its head. I won't wait for those slow fellows." He boarded a ship and sailed through the seas, going very far until he sailed out to the sea in the direction of Tsukushi. What happened then, a swift wind blew, the world darkened, and the wind blew the ship around. Not knowing which direction they were in, the wind spun the ship, about to blow it into the middle of the sea. The waves kept crashing over the ship and engulfing it, and lightning flashed as if the gods were about to fall, and the grand counselor was confused, saying, "I have never seen such misery. What is going to happen?" The helmsman replied, "In all my time sailing on ships, I have never seen such misery. If your ship does not sink to the bottom of the sea, the gods are likely to fall on it. If by good fortune there is divine help, you will be blown to the southern sea. How sad that by serving such a terrible master, I am to die such a meaningless death." The helmsman wept. Hearing this, the grand counselor said, "When on a ship, one should trust the helmsman's words as a high mountain. Why do you say such unreassuring things?" He vomited green bile as he spoke. The helmsman replied, "Not being a god, what skills can I employ? Though the wind blows and the waves are fierce, what appears as if the gods are about to fall on our heads is because you seek to kill a dragon. This is surely the dragon's doing. Quickly pray to the gods." He said, "That's a good idea," and said, "Gods of the helm, hear me. Foolishly and childishly I thought to kill a dragon. From now on, I will not disturb even a single hair. I will not harm it." He recited prayers and cried out while standing and sitting, perhaps around a thousand times, and gradually the storm calmed down. It grew somewhat lighter, but the wind still blew rapidly. The helmsman said, "This is indeed the dragon's doing. This wind that is blowing is a favorable wind, not an evil one. It is blowing towards a good direction." But the grand counselor did not listen to this. After three or four days, they were blown back to shore. Looking at the beach, it was the beach of Akashi in Harima Province. The grand counselor, thinking "We must have been blown to a southern sea beach," lay down in relief. He could not get up from the bottom of the ship. They spread mats on the pine-covered beach and carried him down. It was then that he realized "This is not the southern sea," and when he managed to get up, they saw that he was a very heavy-set person, with a swollen belly, and eyes like two plums attached on either side. Seeing this, even the provincial governor smiled. He had a palanquin made in the province, was carried slowly, and entered his house. Somehow, the men he had sent heard of this and came to say, "Because we could not get the dragon's head jewel, we could not return to the palace. Since you now know how difficult it was to get the jewel, we thought there would be no punishment." The grand counselor rose and said, "You did well not to bring it. The dragon is a type of thunder god. For its jewel, the people around would have been harmed. Moreover, if I had captured the dragon, I too would have been harmed without fail. It is good that it was not caught. That Kaguya-hime is a great thief who wants to kill people. I will not even pass near her house from now on. Men, do not go there either." He gave away the few things that remained in his house to the men who had not brought the dragon's jewel. Hearing this, his former wife, whom he had dismissed, laughed until her stomach hurt. The house he had built with dyed threads was all pecked away by kites and crows for their nests. People in the world said, "Did the Grand Counselor Otomo return with the dragon's jewel?" "No, he returned with jewels like plums added to his two eyes," they said. From this, people began to say "Oh, how tedious!" for things that do not come to fruition in the world.

                The Middle Counselor Isonokami no Maro told the men who served in his house, "If sparrows build nests, let me know." Hearing this order, they asked, "What is it for?" He replied, "It is for taking the cowrie shells that sparrows have." The men answered, "Even if we kill many sparrows and look, they don't have such things in their stomachs. However, they might produce them somehow when they give birth, but they disappear as soon as people see them." Another person said, "Sparrows build nests in the holes of the ridgepoles of every kitchen in the Imperial Cooking Office. If reliable men were sent there, raised on scaffolding, and made to watch, surely the sparrows there would give birth. Then you could have them taken." The middle counselor was delighted and said, "What an interesting thing! I didn't know that at all. You've said something interesting." He sent about twenty reliable men, and they were raised up and placed in the holes. The palace sent messengers frequently, asking, "Have you gotten the cowrie shells?" "The sparrows are frightened by the many people sitting up here and aren't coming to their nests." When this response was given, he heard it and wondered, "What should I do?" As he was troubled by this, an old man named Kuratsumaro, an official from that department, said, "If you want to get a cowrie shell, I will devise a plan." He came before the middle counselor, who greeted him by pressing his forehead to the ground. Kuratsumaro said, "This sparrow's cowrie shell, if you try to get it by evil means, you will not be able to. With the scaffolding so terrifying and twenty people climbing up, they are scared and not coming. What you should do is tear down this scaffolding, have everyone withdraw, place one reliable person in a rough basket, set up ropes, and when the bird is about to give birth, quickly pull up the rope and snatch the cowrie shell. That would be good." The middle counselor said, "That's an excellent idea." He had the scaffolding torn down, and everyone returned. The middle counselor said to Kuratsumaro, "How do you know when a sparrow is about to give birth, so that we can raise the person?" Kuratsumaro said, "When a sparrow is about to give birth, it raises its tail, turns around seven times, and then drops its offspring. So when it has turned seven times, pull the person up, and at that moment, have him take the cowrie shell." The middle counselor was delighted and without telling many people, secretly went to the department, mingled with the men, and had them watch day and night. He was extremely pleased at what Kuratsumaro had said and said, "Even among the people who serve here, there was no one who knew this. How happy I am that my wish will be fulfilled." He took off his robe and gave it to him. "Come to this department tonight," he said and sent him away. When evening fell, he went to that department and saw that indeed, sparrows had built nests. As Kuratsumaro had said, when the sparrow raised its tail and circled, he had a person raised in a rough basket, made him reach into the sparrow's nest, and search, but he said, "There is nothing." The middle counselor, angry, said, "You are not searching well, that's why there's nothing," and said, "Who is most reliable?" "I will climb up and search," he said, getting into the basket, and being pulled up. When the sparrow raised its tail and circled intensely, he raised his hands and searched, and when he felt something flash in his hand, he said, "I have grasped something. Now let me down. The old man was right." People gathered to lower him quickly, but the rope was pulled too straight and broke, and he fell upside down onto a cauldron. People were astonished and gathered to hold him. His eyes were white as he lay there. People scooped water into his mouth. When he finally began to breathe, they took his hands and feet and lowered him from the cauldron. When they asked, "How do you feel?" he said in a faint breath, "I feel something, but I cannot move my lower back. However, I am happy that I have firmly grasped the cowrie shell. First, bring a torch. I want to see this shell's appearance." He raised his head and opened his hand, and what he had grasped was old sparrow droppings. Seeing this, he said, "What a worthless thing," and from this, people began to call things that fall short of expectations "worthless." Seeing that it was "not a shell," his condition worsened, and he could not even be placed on the lid of a Chinese chest, for his lower back was broken. The middle counselor had done a childish thing, and though he tried to keep his illness secret from people, he became very weak from this sickness. More than not being able to get the shell, he thought increasingly day by day of how people would laugh when they heard, and he felt more ashamed than simply being sick and dying. Hearing of this, Kaguya-hime sent a poem of condolence:

                Over the years, I hear that at Sumiyoshi,
                Where the waves do not reach, the pine is in vain.

                Reading this, he raised his head in his very weak state and had someone hold paper for him, and with difficulty, he wrote:

                Since this is how shells are, in desperation,
                Will you not save my dying life?

                After writing this, he breathed his last. Hearing this, Kaguya-hime felt some pity. From that time on, people began to call something slightly delightful "worthwhile."

                Now, the Emperor heard that Kaguya-hime's beauty was unparalleled in the world, and said to the Lady-in-Waiting Nakatomi no Fusako, "This Kaguya-hime, who has made many men waste their lives without meeting her, what kind of woman is she?" "Go and see her, and return to tell me," he commanded. Fusako obeyed and went. She was shown reverence at the bamboo cutter's house and invited in to meet him. The lady-in-waiting said to the old woman, "By imperial command, I have come to see Kaguya-hime, as it is said that she is remarkably beautiful. I was told to see her well and return." She replied, "I will tell her so," and went in. To Kaguya-hime, she said, "Please quickly meet that imperial messenger." Kaguya-hime replied, "I am not of good appearance. How could I be seen?" "How can you say such a thing? How could we treat the Emperor's messenger rudely?" Kaguya-hime answered, "I do not think the Emperor's summons is something to be feared." She would not show herself. Though she was like their own child, she spoke with a sense of modest embarrassment and aloofness, so they could not force her against her will. The old woman returned to the lady-in-waiting and said, "Regrettably, this young person is shy and will not meet you." The lady-in-waiting said, "I was ordered to 'Definitely see her and return.' How can I return without seeing her? How could a person who lives in the world not obey the King's command? Do not say impossible things." She spoke with embarrassing words, and hearing this, Kaguya-hime became even less inclined to listen. "If I disobey the King's command, just kill me," she said. The lady-in-waiting returned and reported this to the Emperor. The Emperor heard this and said, "She must have the heart of someone who has killed many people," and let the matter drop. But still thinking about it, he thought, "Perhaps I was defeated by this woman's schemes." So he summoned the bamboo cutter and commanded, "Offer me the Kaguya-hime you have. I have heard that her face and form are beautiful, and though I sent a messenger many times, she would not show herself. Should she be so haughty? The old man replied fearfully, "This girl is absolutely not suited to serve at court, and I am troubled by having her. But still, I will go and tell her what you have commanded." The Emperor, hearing this, said, "Why would you not be able to control a person you have raised in your own hands? If you offer this woman, why would I not grant you a cap of rank?" The old man was delighted, returned home, and said to Kaguya-hime, "This is what the Emperor has commanded. Will you still not serve him?" Kaguya-hime replied, "I have no intention of doing such court service. If you force me to serve, I will disappear. The appointment as an officer with a cap will only lead to death." The old man answered, "Don't do that. What good is an official cap without seeing my child? Even if that happens, why would you not serve at court? How could you die?" "See if it's a lie or not by having me serve and seeing if I don't die. Though I have made empty the intentions of many people, it would be disgraceful to people's ears to attach myself to what the Emperor says today or tomorrow." The old man replied, "You speak as I thought. So what kind of intention would you want from a person you would meet? Surely these people have shown no lack of dedication." Kaguya-hime said, "How much depth should I look for? It's a small matter. People's intentions are all the same. How could I know which is inferior or superior in the middle? Tell those gentlemen, 'To whichever one shows me an object of desire, I shall say, "Your intention is superior," and serve him.'" The old man readily agreed. By evening, they gathered as usual. Some played flutes, some sang songs, some chanted, some whistled, some made sounds with fans, when the old man came out and said, "I express my deepest gratitude that despite the shabby and dirty place, you have come for months and years to show your extreme respect. She says, 'Since the old man's life is uncertain, I should decide well and serve one of you gentlemen who speak thus.' She also says, 'Without knowing your deep hearts.' This too is reasonable. 'Since I cannot tell which of you is inferior or superior, to whichever shows me an object of desire, I shall determine the depth of your intention. That is whom I shall serve.' That's what she says. This is a good thing. No one need be resentful." When the five men said, "This is a good thing," the old man went inside to tell her. Kaguya-hime said to Prince Ishizukuri, "There is a begging bowl of the Buddha in India. Please bring that to me." To Prince Kuramochi, she said, "There is a mountain called Horai in the eastern sea. There is a tree there with roots of silver, a trunk of gold, and fruit of white jade. Please break off a branch and bring it to me." To one person, she said, "Please bring me the robe of the fire-rat from China." To Otomo no Daijin, she said, "There is a jewel that shines in five colors on the neck of a dragon. Please bring that to me." To Isonokami no Chunagon, she said, "Please bring me a cowrie shell from the swallow." The old man said, "These are difficult things indeed. These are not things found in this country. How can I tell them such difficult things?" Kaguya-hime said, "What is difficult about it?" The old man said, "I will tell them regardless." He went out and said, "This is what she says. Please show her as you hear." Hearing this, the princes and nobles said, "Does she not even say, 'Just bring something from nearby'?" They all groaned and returned home.

                "Since I cannot bear to live without seeing this woman, could I not bring something from India?" Prince Ishizukuri, being a resourceful person, thought, "How could I go thousands of miles to India and get a bowl that is unique in the world?" He let Kaguya-hime know, "Today I am leaving for India to get the stone bowl," but after about three years, he took a bowl from a mountain temple in Yamato Province in the county of Toichi, which was covered in soot before Binzuru, put it in a brocade bag, attached it to a branch of artificial flowers, and brought it to Kaguya-hime's house to show her. Kaguya-hime looked at it suspiciously, and inside the bowl was a letter. When she unfolded it and read it, it said:

                For sea and mountain paths, I spent my heart
                And shed tears over this stone bowl.

                Kaguya-hime looked to see if it shone, but there was not even the light of a firefly.

                If you had stored even the light of dew,
                Why did you search on Mount Ogura?

                She sent it back, throwing the bowl at the gate and composing a reply to his poem.

                If, approaching White Mountain, the light faded,
                Why throw away the bowl and still hope?

                She wrote this and sent it in. Kaguya-hime did not reply further and did not listen, so he became troubled and returned home. Since he had thrown away the bowl when he spoke again, from that time on, they began to say that an embarrassing thing was "throwing away one's face."

                Prince Kuramochi, being resourceful, announced publicly, "I will go to bathe in the hot springs of Tsukushi Province," and requested leave, but he told Kaguya-hime's household, "I am going to get the jeweled branch." The servants who were to attend him all accompanied him as far as Naniwa. The prince said, "Very secretly," and did not take many people with him, departing only with those who served him closely. Those who had accompanied him to see him off returned. He made it appear to people that he had departed, but after about three days, he paddled back. Since he had already given all his orders, he summoned the six best craftsmen and had them build a house that ordinary people could not easily approach, with three layers of fences around it. The prince secluded himself in the same place with the craftsmen, and as he had instructed them, they opened a vent for smoke at the top and created a jeweled branch. They made it exactly as Kaguya-hime had described. With great resourcefulness, they secretly brought it out to Naniwa. He sent word to the palace, "I have returned by boat," and sat with a very pained expression. Many people came to welcome him. The jeweled branch was placed in a long chest, covered, and brought along. Somehow the news had spread: "Prince Kuramochi has returned with the flower of the udumbara." People were buzzing about this. When Kaguya-hime heard this, she thought, "I may have to yield to this prince," and felt her chest tightening. At that moment, someone knocked at the gate and announced, "Prince Kuramochi has arrived." "He has come in his travel attire," was the message. She met him. The prince said, "Tell Kaguya-hime, 'I have brought the jeweled branch, risking my life.' Show it to her." The old man took it in. The jeweled branch had a letter attached.

                Though I may have wasted my life, had I not broken off
                This jeweled branch with my hand, I would never have returned.

                Looking at this with emotion, the bamboo cutter ran in and said, "This prince has brought the jeweled branch from Horai as you requested, with not one part of it missing. What more can I say? He came directly to our house without even returning to his own, still in his travel attire. Please quickly agree to serve this prince." But she said nothing, resting her cheek on her hand with a deeply troubled expression. The prince said, "There is nothing more to be said now," and climbed up onto the veranda. The old man thought this was reasonable. "This is a jeweled branch not seen in this country. How could she not be persuaded this time? And he is a fine person." This was his thought. Kaguya-hime said, "Because I am reluctant to stubbornly refuse what my parent says, I find it vexing that such a difficult object has been brought so easily." The old man prepared the inner chamber. The old man said to the prince, "In what place was this tree growing? It is strangely beautiful and splendid." The prince replied, "Around the end of February the year before last, I boarded a ship at Naniwa and went out to sea, not knowing which way to go, but thinking, 'If I cannot fulfill my wish, what use is there in living in this world?' So I entrusted myself to the aimless wind. 'If I die, so be it. As long as I am alive, I will wander like this and perhaps encounter the mountain called Horai.' I floated on the waves and paddled around, leaving our country's shores, and at times the waves were rough, and I nearly sank to the bottom of the sea. At times the wind blew me to unknown countries where monstrous beings came out to kill me. At times I did not know where I was coming from or going to, and was about to be lost at sea. At times I ran out of provisions and ate grass roots for food. At times indescribably horrific beings came to attack me. At times I collected seashells to sustain my life. With no one to help me in that foreign sky, I suffered various illnesses, without even knowing where I was, drifting on the sea at the mercy of the boat, floating on the ocean, and around the five hundredth day, at about the hour of the dragon, a mountain appeared in the distance on the sea. I strained to look from the boat. It was a very large mountain floating on the sea. The mountain was tall and beautiful. I thought, 'This must be the mountain I seek,' but I felt afraid and circled around the mountain for two or three days, when a woman dressed like a celestial being came out from the mountain carrying a silver basin to draw water. Seeing this, I got off the boat and asked, 'What is the name of this mountain?' The woman answered, 'This is Mount Horai.' Hearing this, I felt boundless joy. I asked the woman, 'Who are you?' She said, 'My name is Hokan Ruri,' and suddenly disappeared into the mountain. Looking at that mountain, there seemed to be no way to climb it. Circling around the foot of the mountain, there were trees with flowers not found in this world. Streams of gold, silver, and lapis lazuli flowed out. Bridges of various jewels spanned them. Trees that glowed and sparkled grew in that area. Among them, this one that I have brought back was actually quite inferior, but I thought, 'If I don't bring what she asked for,' so I broke off this flower and brought it back. The mountain is limitlessly beautiful, beyond comparison with anything in the world, but after breaking off this branch, I felt unsettled and boarded the ship, and with a tailwind, I have come back after more than four hundred days. Perhaps by the power of my great wish, I arrived in the capital from Naniwa just yesterday. I have come here without even changing my clothes soaked in seawater." Hearing this, the old man sighed and composed this poem:

                I who have only seen the knotty nodes of the bamboo in Yoshino,
                How sad I have been, wandering through fields and mountains.

                Hearing this, the prince said, "My heart, which has been suffering these days, has found relief today," and replied:

                Since my sleeves are fresh today,
                I will be able to forget the number of bitter grasses I endured.

                Meanwhile, six men entered the garden together. One man held a document case with a letter and announced, "I, Takenouchi no Kasamaro, craftsman of the Bureau of Works, say this: 'The making of the jeweled tree that I served you with consumed my heart, and I expended no small effort over more than a thousand days. Yet I have not received my payment. Please grant this and divide it among the men.'" He presented the letter. The bamboo cutter asked, "What is this claim from these craftsmen about?" and inclined his head. The prince sat with an expression that was not himself, feeling as if his liver would dissolve. Hearing this, Kaguya-hime said, "Take this letter," and reading it, the document stated: "His Highness the Prince secluded himself with humble craftsmen for more than a thousand days in the same place, having us create a splendid jeweled branch, and told us, 'I will grant you an official position.' Considering this recently, we have learned that 'This branch is for Princess Kaguya, whom you are to wed.' Please grant us what you promised from this palace." Hearing this, Kaguya-hime's heart, which had been sinking all evening, blossomed in scornful laughter, and she called the old man and said, "I truly thought it might be a branch from Horai, but since it turns out to be such an outrageous lie, please quickly send him away." The old man responded, "Since I have clearly heard that it was made, it is very easy to return it. I agree." With Kaguya-hime's heart fully satisfied, she replied to the previous poem:

                I thought it was real, but when I saw it,
                It was just a jeweled branch decorated with words.

                She returned the jeweled branch as well. The bamboo cutter, who had been speaking so much, fell asleep, embarrassed by the revelation. The prince stood half-sitting, half-standing. When evening came, he had no choice but to leave. Kaguya-hime called the concerned craftsmen, saying, "You are delightful people," and gave them a very generous payment. The craftsmen were extremely pleased, saying, "Things have turned out as we hoped." On the way back, Prince Kuramochi had them beaten until they bled. Although they had received payment, he made them throw it all away, and they ran off. Thus, this prince said, "There is no greater shame in life than this. Not only have I failed to get the woman, but the embarrassment of being seen by people all over the land." He entered a deep mountain alone. Though the palace officials all split up to search for him, perhaps he had died, for they could not find him. It seems that he had hidden himself, intending to accompany the prince, and had not been seen for years. This is what people began to call "scarce."

                The Right Minister Abe no Miushi was a wealthy man with a large household. He wrote a letter to Wang Qing, who had come on a ship from China that year, saying, "Buy me what they call the robe of the fire-rat and send it to me." He selected a trustworthy person from among his servants, a man called Ono no Fusamori, and sent him along with gold. Upon arrival, he gave the gold to Wang Qing on that shore. Wang Qing read the letter and replied: "The robe of the fire-rat is not found in our country. I have heard of it but never seen it. If it existed in the world, it would have been brought to our country. It is a very difficult trade. However, if by chance it is brought over from India, or if I inquire among the wealthy, and if it does not exist, I will return the gold with the messenger." The Chinese ship arrived. Hearing that Ono no Fusamori was coming up to the capital, he sent a horse that could run without stopping to meet him, and he rode up from Tsukushi to the capital in just seven days. Looking at the letter, it said: "With great difficulty, I have sent people out to search for and offer you the robe of the fire-rat. This skin is something that is not easily obtainable, either in the present or past ages. I heard that a holy man from wise India who had come to our country had it in a western mountain temple, and applying to the government, I managed with difficulty to buy it for you. Since the provincial governor's messenger said the price in gold was small, Wang Qing added his own resources to buy it. Now fifty ryo of gold should be granted. Send it back with the returning ship. If you do not grant the gold, please return the robe as collateral." Seeing this, he said, "What do you think? The matter of a little gold is nothing. This is certainly something that should be sent. How delightful that they sent it!" He prostrated himself facing China in gratitude. Looking at the box in which the robe was placed, it was made of various beautiful pieces of lapis lazuli. Looking at the robe, it was an indigo color. The tips of the fur shone with golden light. Indeed, it looked like a treasure, and its beauty was incomparable. The fact that it did not burn in fire made it uniquely clean. "No wonder Kaguya-hime desired it," he said, and reverently placed it back in the box, attached it to a branch, made himself look very sick, and thinking he would stay the night, added a poem and brought it. The poem was:

                This robe, which cannot burn in the limitless passion of fire,
                Today I shall wear it with dry sleeves.

                He stood at the gate of the house. The bamboo cutter came out, took it in, and showed it to Kaguya-hime. Kaguya-hime, looking at the robe, said, "It seems to be a beautiful skin. But I do not know if it is genuine." The bamboo cutter replied, "Anyway, let me first invite him in. Since this is a robe not seen in the world, please consider it genuine. Do not make the person suffer unnecessarily." He invited him in. Having invited him in, "This time we will surely meet," thought the old woman in her heart. This old man was distressed that Kaguya-hime was unmarried, so he thought, "I will match her with a good person," but she firmly refused, so it was natural that he could not force her. Kaguya-hime said to the old man, "I will believe this robe is genuine if it does not burn in fire, and I will yield to what people say. Since it is something not found in the world, I will believe without doubt that it is genuine." She said, "Now I will still burn this and see." The old man said, "That's reasonable," and told the minister, "This is what she says." The minister replied, "This skin was not even found in China, and was sought and obtained with great difficulty. What doubt could there be? But if she says so, go ahead and burn it to see." They threw it into the fire to burn, and it burned with bright flames. "So it really wasn't a special skin," they said. Seeing this, the minister's face turned the color of leaves, while Kaguya-hime sat there delighted, saying, "How wonderful." She put her reply to his poem in the box and returned it.

                If I had known it would burn without a trace,
                I would have looked at the fire-robe apart from my thoughts.

                So he returned home. People in the world asked, "Did Minister Abe bring the fire-rat's robe and marry Kaguya-hime? Is she here?" Some people said, "When the robe was put in the fire, it burned with bright flames, so Kaguya-hime did not meet him." Hearing this, people began to call something that does not bear fruit "fruitless."

                The Emperor heard of Kaguya-hime, whose beauty was unmatched in the world, and said to the Lady-in-Waiting Nakatomi no Fusako, "This Kaguya-hime, who has made many men waste their lives without meeting her, what kind of woman is she?" "Go and see her, and return to tell me," he commanded. Fusako obeyed and went. She was shown reverence at the bamboo cutter's house and invited in to meet him. The lady-in-waiting said to the old woman, "By imperial command, I have come to see Kaguya-hime, as it is said that she is remarkably beautiful. I was told to see her well and return." She replied, "I will tell her so," and went in. To Kaguya-hime, she said, "Please quickly meet that imperial messenger." Kaguya-hime replied, "I am not of good appearance. How could I be seen?" "How can you say such a thing? How could we treat the Emperor's messenger rudely?" Kaguya-hime answered, "I do not think the Emperor's summons is something to be feared." She would not show herself. Though she was like their own child, she spoke with a sense of modest embarrassment and aloofness, so they could not force her against her will. The old woman returned to the lady-in-waiting and said, "Regrettably, this young person is shy and will not meet you." The lady-in-waiting said, "I was ordered to 'Definitely see her and return.' How can I return without seeing her? How could a person who lives in the world not obey the King's command? Do not say impossible things." She spoke with embarrassing words, and hearing this, Kaguya-hime became even less inclined to listen. "If I disobey the King's command, just kill me," she said. The lady-in-waiting returned and reported this to the Emperor. The Emperor heard this and said, "She must have the heart of someone who has killed many people," and let the matter drop. But still thinking about it, he thought, "Perhaps I was defeated by this woman's schemes." So he summoned the bamboo cutter and commanded, "Offer me the Kaguya-hime you have. I have heard that her face and form are beautiful, and though I sent a messenger many times, she would not show herself. Should she be so haughty?" The old man replied fearfully, "This girl is absolutely not suited to serve at court, and I am troubled by having her. But still, I will go and tell her what you have commanded." The Emperor, hearing this, said, "Why would you not be able to control a person you have raised in your own hands? If you offer this woman, why would I not grant you a cap of rank?" The old man was delighted, returned home, and said to Kaguya-hime, "This is what the Emperor has commanded. Will you still not serve him?" Kaguya-hime replied, "I have no intention of doing such court service. If you force me to serve, I will disappear. The appointment as an officer with a cap will only lead to death." The old man answered, "Don't do that. What good is an official cap without seeing my child? Even if that happens, why would you not serve at court? How could you die?" "See if it's a lie or not by having me serve and seeing if I don't die. Though I have made empty the intentions of many people, it would be disgraceful to people's ears to attach myself to what the Emperor says today or tomorrow." The old man replied, "You speak as I thought. So what kind of intention would you want from a person you would meet? Surely these people have shown no lack of dedication." Kaguya-hime said, "What depth should I look for? It's a small matter. People's intentions are all the same. How could I know which is inferior or superior? Tell those gentlemen, 'To whichever one shows me an object of desire, I shall say, "Your intention is superior," and serve him.'" He agreed. The old man said to the Emperor, "She will not serve at court, saying, 'I was not born in this country,' and when I spoke to her about serving, she says, 'I will die.' I did not give birth to her; I found her in the mountains long ago. Therefore, her temperament is unlike people of the world." The Emperor said, "The bamboo cutter's house is near the foot of the mountain. I will go hunting and see her that way." The bamboo cutter said, "That would be an excellent thing. How could she be without a heart when you suddenly come to see her?" When he reported this, the Emperor quickly set a date, went out hunting, entered Kaguya-hime's house, and saw a person sitting there, full of light and beauty. "This must be her," he thought, and when he approached her, she tried to escape inside. He grabbed her sleeve, but she covered her face. However, he had already seen her well, and finding her incomparably beautiful, he said, "I will not let you go," and tried to take her away, but Kaguya-hime replied, "If I were born in this country, I would serve you, but it would be very difficult for you to take me away." The Emperor said, "How could that be? I will still take you away," and brought his palanquin close, but Kaguya-hime became invisible. "How fleeting and regrettable," he thought, and thinking, "Indeed, she is not an ordinary person," he said, "Then I will not take you with me. Return to your original form. I will at least see that and then return." When he commanded this, Kaguya-hime returned to her original form. The Emperor still found her splendidly beautiful, and his feelings were difficult to suppress. He was pleased with the bamboo cutter who had shown her to him. The host served the attending officials with great ceremony. The Emperor, reluctant to leave Kaguya-hime behind and return, felt as if his soul was being left behind as he returned. After she was placed in the palanquin, the Emperor wrote to Kaguya-hime:

                As I return, the snow seems heavy to me,
                Because of Princess Kaguya, who turned away and stayed.

                She replied:

                For years I have lived under the vines,
                Why should I look upon the jeweled pavilion?

                Seeing this, the Emperor felt even more that there was no way to return. His heart would not allow him to return, but since he could not spend the night, he returned. Looking at the people who usually served him, none of them could even come near Kaguya-hime. The people he had thought were beautiful, when compared to her, were not even human. Only Kaguya-hime occupied his heart, and he spent his days thinking only of her. He did not visit his various ladies, but sent letters to Kaguya-hime's residence. Though her responses were somewhat cold, they exchanged poems, and even with beautiful plants and trees, he composed poems and sent them to her.

                In this way, as they consoled their hearts with each other, about three years passed, and from the beginning of spring, Kaguya-hime looked at the beautiful moon that had risen and appeared more melancholy than usual. Though someone had warned her, "Gazing at the moon's face is a taboo," whenever possible, she would sit in a room and look at the moon, weeping intensely. People who served her closely told the bamboo cutter, "Though Kaguya-hime has always found the moon moving, these days it seems unusual. She must be deeply troubled by something. Please watch her carefully." Hearing this, he said to Kaguya-hime, "Why do you look at the moon with such a melancholy expression? What an unfortunate world." Kaguya-hime replied, "When I look at the moon, the world seems lonely and moving. Why would I be grieving about anything?" The bamboo cutter went to where Kaguya-hime was and saw that she indeed had a melancholy expression. Seeing this, he said, "My Buddha, what are you thinking about? What is it that you are thinking?" She replied, "I am not thinking of anything. Things just seem melancholy." "Don't look at the moon. When you look at it, you appear to be thinking of something," he said. "How could I not look at the moon?" she replied, and still, when the moon rose, she would go out and sit, lamenting and thinking. In the twilight, she did not appear melancholy. When it was time for the moon, she would still occasionally sigh and weep. Seeing this, those who served her said, "She must still be thinking of something," but neither her parents nor anyone else knew what it was. Around the fifteenth day of the eighth month, Kaguya-hime sat under the moon and wept intensely. She no longer tried to hide her tears from others. Seeing this, her parents asked, "What is it?" Kaguya-hime, weeping, said, "I was thinking of telling you earlier, but I thought, 'You will surely be troubled,' so I have kept it to myself until now. I thought, 'But what if?' and now it has come out. I am not a person of this country, but a person of the Capital of the Moon. Due to a past agreement, I came to this world. Now the time has come for me to return, and on the fifteenth day of this month, people will come from that country to escort me back. I must go, so from this spring, I have been grieving and lamenting, thinking of how sad you will be." She wept intensely. The old man said, "What are you saying? I found you in a bamboo, and though you were the size of a bean seed, I have raised you until you stand as tall as me. You are my child. Who could possibly come to take you away? I would never allow it." He said, "I would rather die," and his weeping and wailing seemed unbearable. Kaguya-hime said, "I am a person of the Capital of the Moon with parents there. Though I came from that country for just a moment, I have spent many years in this country. I don't even remember my parents in that country. Here, I have grown accustomed to playing for so long that I don't feel too bad. I only feel sad. However, I must go against my own will." She wept together with them. The serving people, having grown accustomed to her over the years, found it unbearable to think of parting from her, having seen her gentle manner and beauty. They could not even drink water, and lamented with the same heart. The Emperor heard of this and sent a messenger to the bamboo cutter's house. The bamboo cutter met the messenger and wept without limit. Lamenting this, his hair had turned white, his back bent, his eyes blurred. The old man was about fifty this year, but "In grief, I have aged in an instant," he appeared. The messenger announced the imperial command to the old man, saying, "Is it true that you are so distressed?" The bamboo cutter, weeping, replied, "In this full moon, people from the Capital of the Moon will come to escort Kaguya-hime back. Your honorable inquiry is appreciated. In this full moon, please grant me people to capture those who come from the Capital of the Moon." The messenger returned and reported the old man's condition and what he had said. Hearing this, the Emperor said, "Even with just one glimpse, I cannot forget her, so how must they feel who have seen her morning and evening? How could they bear to let Kaguya-hime go?" On that fifteenth day, he commanded the officials, and as an imperial envoy, he sent a person called Takano no Okuni, a minor captain, along with the chiefs of the six guards, and two thousand men to the bamboo cutter's house.

                Going to the house, a thousand men were placed on the walls, a thousand on the roof, and along with the many people of the house, they guarded it without leaving a single gap. These guardsmen wore bows and arrows. Inside the main house, women were stationed as guards. The old woman held Kaguya-hime in her arms inside a plastered room. The old man also pushed the door of the plastered room and sat at the entrance. The old man said, "Even celestial beings would not defeat us in a place so well-guarded." He said to the people sitting on the roof, "If anything flies through the air, shoot it dead immediately." The guardians replied, "In a place guarded like this, if even a bat appeared, we would first shoot it dead and display it outside." Hearing this, the old man felt reassured. Hearing this, Kaguya-hime said, "Even if you are locked up and prepared for battle, you cannot fight the people of that country. You cannot shoot them with bows and arrows. Even if you surround me like this, when the people of that country come, all of this will be futile. If you try to fight, when the people of that country come, no one here will have a fierce heart." The old man said, "When those who come to escort you arrive, I will scratch out their eyes with long nails. I will grab their hair and throw them down. I will pull out their buttocks and show them to the officials here to shame them." He sat there angrily. Kaguya-hime said, "Don't speak so loudly. The people on the roof will hear. It is regrettable that I must leave without knowing the intentions you have shown. I think, 'Perhaps because there was no long agreement, I must leave so soon,' and that makes me sad. I cannot even serve my parents a little, and the path I must take will not be easy. I have been sitting out looking at the moon for months, and asked for this year's respite, but you would not allow it, so I have been grieving. The thought of leaving and confusing your hearts is sorrowful and unbearable. The people of that Capital are very beautiful and do not age. There is nothing to think about. Going to such a place is not so terrible. What will be sad is not seeing you as you grow old. That is what I will miss." She wept. The old man said, "Don't say things that hurt my chest. I won't harm the beautiful messengers." He sat there jealously.

                As this was happening, as the night passed, around the hour of the Child, the area around the house became brighter than day. It was as bright as combining ten full moons, bright enough to see even the pores on people's skin. People descended from the great sky riding on clouds, standing in a line about five feet above the ground. Seeing this, the hearts of the people inside and outside felt as if they were possessed by something, and they had no will to fight. Though they tried to gather their thoughts and take up their bows and arrows, their hands lost strength and they crouched down. Among them, a quick-witted person tried with determination to shoot, but his arrow went outward, so they did not fight either, but stood guard with confused minds. The standing people's clothing was incomparably clean. They had one flying chariot. They held a feathered canopy. Among them, a person who appeared to be a king said, "Tsukurimaro, come to the house." The fierce-minded Tsukurimaro fell face down as if drunk. He said, "You, small person, the old man created some small merit, and as your helper, we sent you down for a moment, but there for several years, given gold, you have become like someone who has purchased their body. Kaguya-hime, because she committed a sin, was briefly placed with such a humble you. Now that the limit of her sin has ended, we have come to escort her, but the old man weeps and laments, which is futile. Quickly return her." The old man replied, "I have raised Kaguya-hime for more than twenty years. You say 'a moment,' which is strange. Perhaps there is another person called Kaguya-hime elsewhere." "The Kaguya-hime here is very ill and cannot go out," he said, but receiving no reply to that, the chariot was brought to the roof, and someone said, "Come, Kaguya-hime, how long can you stay in such a defiled place?" The door of the secluded room immediately opened. The lattices also opened without anyone touching them. Kaguya-hime, whom the old woman was holding, went outside. Since she could not be stopped, they just looked up and wept.

                Kaguya-hime approached the bamboo cutter, who was lying in confusion and weeping, and said, "Though I am leaving against my will, please at least see me off as I ascend." But he replied, "Why would I want to see such a sad thing? How can you abandon me and ascend? Come with me and take me along." Since he lay down and wept, her heart was confused. "I will write a letter and leave. When you miss me, take it out and look at it." Weeping, she wrote these words: "If I had been born in this country, I would not have stayed with you until you grieved. That I am leaving without staying is truly against my intentions. The clothes I am taking off, please keep as a memento. On nights when the moon has risen, please look up at it. My heart feels as if it will fall from the sky I am leaving." The letter was finished. Among the celestial beings, there was a box. It contained a celestial robe. Another contained the elixir of immortality. One celestial being said, "Please take this medicine in the jar. Since you have eaten food from an unclean place, you may feel unwell." When they brought it to her, she tasted a little, and wanted to keep a little as a memento, so she tried to wrap it in the clothes she was taking off, but one celestial being would not allow it, and took out the robe to dress her. At that time, Kaguya-hime said, "Wait a moment." "A person who wears this robe has a change of heart. I have one word to say." She wrote a letter. The celestial being felt impatient. Kaguya-hime said, "Don't speak so ignorantly." She very calmly offered a letter to the court. Her manner was unhurried. "Though you granted many people to detain me, an unyielding escort has come, and they are taking me away, which is regrettable and sad. That I have not served at court, being in such a troubled state, you may have misunderstood, but my heart remains on how I unrelentingly did not obey, and how you considerately did not abandon me."

                Now as I go to wear the celestial robe,
                It is you whom I remember with sadness.

                She attached the jar of medicine, called the Head Chamberlain, and had him offer it. The Head Chamberlain took it and passed it to a celestial being. When the chamberlain had taken it, the celestial being quickly put the celestial robe on her, and the feelings of fondness and sadness for the old man disappeared. When a person wears this robe, their thoughts disappear, so she boarded the chariot with about a hundred celestial beings and ascended. After that, the old man and woman shed tears of blood and were confused, but to no avail. They read aloud the letter she had written, but they said, "What use is life now? For whom would anything be good?" They did not take the medicine but lay sick in bed without even getting up. The chamberlain returned with the people, and reported in detail that they had been unable to fight and detain Kaguya-hime. He presented the jar of medicine with the letter. The Emperor read it and was deeply moved, unable to hear anything, and there were no entertainments.

                He summoned the ministers and nobles and asked, "Which mountain is closest to heaven?" Someone replied, "In Suruga Province, there is a mountain that is close to the capital and close to heaven." Hearing this, he wrote:

                For a body that floats in tears for a meeting,
                What use is an immortality medicine?

                He gave the jar of immortality medicine and a letter to an imperial messenger. As the messenger, he called a person named Tsuwamono Iwakasa and commanded him to take it to the peak of the mountain in Suruga Province. He instructed him on what to do at the peak. He commanded him to place the letter and the jar of immortality medicine side by side and burn them. Accepting this command, he took many soldiers and climbed the mountain, and from that time, that mountain was named Mount Fuji. It is said that the smoke still rises into the clouds.`,

                  content: `从前有一个名叫竹取翁的人。他在山野中采竹子，用于各种事物。他的名字叫讃岐造麻吕。在那些竹子中，有一根发光的竹子。他感到奇怪，走近一看，发现竹筒里面在发光。仔细一看，里面坐着一个约三寸高的非常美丽的小人。翁说："我每天早晚都看到这竹子里有什么，现在终于知道了，这一定是注定要成为我的孩子的人。"说着，他把她捧在手中带回家。交给妻子老婆婆抚养。美丽得无法形容。因为太小了，就放在笼子里养。竹取翁发现这孩子后，每次砍竹子，隔着几个节就能找到一根里面有金子的竹子。如此这般，翁渐渐变得富裕起来。这孩子被养育着，很快就长大了。大约三个月的时候，就长成了一个适当大小的人，于是给她梳头，让她穿上了裳装。她被安置在帐幕内，被精心照料养育。这孩子的容貌清丽无比，家中到处充满了光明。翁心情不好、感到痛苦的时候，只要看到这个孩子，痛苦就会停止。愤怒的事情也会平息。翁采竹已有很长时间，成了一个有势力的人。这孩子长大后，名字被定为三室户斋部秋田。秋田给她取名为"娜佑竹的辉夜姬"。在这期间，连续举行了三天的庆祝活动。进行了各种各样的游戏。不分男女地邀请了许多人，举行了盛大的庆祝活动。

                全世界的男子，无论贵贱，都听说了辉夜姬的美名，为之倾倒，都想"如何得到这辉夜姬，如何见到她。"即使是在附近围墙或房门旁的人，也不容易看到她，晚上睡不着觉，在黑夜里出去，在围墙上挖洞，到处窥视。从那时起人们就称之为"求婚"。尽管人们对一个不把他人放在眼里的地方如此迷恋，但似乎没有什么效果。虽然他们向家中的人表达了自己的心意，但没有被理会。不离左右的公子们，日夜守候的人很多。愚蠢的人说："毫无益处的奔走是没有意义的。"就不再来了。在这些人中，仍然继续来访的五位以风流闻名的人，日夜不断地来。他们的名字分别是石作皇子、车持皇子、右大臣阿倍御主人、大纳言大伴御行和中纳言石上麻吕，就是这五个人。他们是那种即使听说世上有哪个长得稍微好看的女子，也想见一见的人，所以对辉夜姬更是向往不已，茶饭不思，却只能站在那所房子前徘徊，但没有什么效果。虽然他们写信给她，但没有回信；虽然他们写恋歌寄去，但也没有回应。虽然他们觉得"没有用"，但在十一月十二月的寒冻中，在六月的烈日下，风雨无阻地前来。这些人有时候叫出竹取翁，俯身拜倒，搓着手说："把女儿给我吧。"但翁却说："那不是我生的孩子，所以她不会听从我的心意。"就这样日子一天天过去。因此这些人回到家中，思虑着，做各种祈祷，许下各种愿望，想要放弃念头却无法做到。"不管怎样，最终她不会不嫁给一个男人吧。"这么想着，他们寄予希望，热情地表达自己的心意。看到这种情况，翁对辉夜姬说："我的孩子，虽然说你是佛的化身，但我也把你养到这么大，我的心意并不轻浮。翁要说的话，你愿意听吗？"辉夜姬说："有什么事我会不听从呢？虽然我不知道自己是否真的是化身，但我一直把你当作父亲。"翁说："你说的真让人高兴。翁已经七十多岁了，不知道今天明天会发生什么。这个世界上的人，男人想要遇到女人，女人想要遇到男人。这样门户才会宽广。你怎么能没有这样的事呢？"辉夜姬说："为什么会有这样的事呢？"翁回答："虽然你是化身，但你有女人的身体。只要翁活着，就这样也没关系。这些人经年累月地来访，你考虑一下，一个一个地去见他们吧。"辉夜姬说："我只是担心，如果只是因为容貌而不了解我内心的深处，如果对方只是抱着轻浮的心，后来可能会有遗憾。我认为即使是世上贤明的人，如果不了解我内心深处的想法，也很难相处。"翁说："你说得很有道理。那么你想与什么样的人相处呢？像这样心意并不轻浮的人已经很难得了。"辉夜姬说："怎么能看出多深的情意呢？这是个小小的要求。人们的心意都差不多。怎么能知道谁优谁劣呢？请你告诉那些人：'五个人中，谁能给我带来最令人向往的物品，我就嫁给谁。'"翁说："这是个好主意。"到了傍晚，他们像往常一样聚集在一起。有的吹笛子，有的唱歌，有的吟诵，有的吹口哨，有的扇扇子，在做着各种事情。翁出来说："非常感谢诸位长期以来不辞辛劳地来到这样卑微的地方。我对辉夜姬说：'翁的生命不知道今天明天会如何，在这样的情况下，各位如此恳求，你应该好好考虑一下，选择一位相伴。'她回答说：'如果不了解他们深切的心意，就很难接受。'这话也有道理。她说：'因为不知道谁更胜一筹，所以谁能拿来令人向往的物品，就能从中看出诚意。我会嫁给那个人。'这是个好主意，这样就不会有人抱怨了。"五个人都说："这是个好主意。"翁进去告诉了辉夜姬。辉夜姬对石作皇子说："天竺有一个佛的石钵，请你把它拿来。"对车持皇子说："东海有一座蓬莱山，山上有一棵树，树根是白银，茎是黄金，果实是白玉。请你折一枝回来。"对另一个人（阿倍大臣）说："请带来唐土的火鼠裘。"对大伴大纳言说："龙的头上有一颗发出五色光芒的宝珠，请你把它取来。"对石上中纳言说："请取来燕子所衔的子安贝。"翁说："这些事情都很困难啊。这些东西都不在日本，这么难的事情我该怎么跟他们说呢？"辉夜姬说："有什么难的呢？"翁说："无论如何，我会告诉他们的。"他出去后对那些人说："她是这样说的，请按照她所说的去做。"皇子们和其他高官听到后说："她轻易地说'不要到处乱走'了吗？"他们都叹了口气，回去了。

                "如果不能见到这个女子，就不想活在这个世上了"，于是他们思索着各种办法。石作皇子是个心思灵巧的人，他想："天竺独一无二的钵，即使我走过千万里路，怎么可能拿得到呢？"于是他对辉夜姬说："今天我要去天竺取石钵。"但实际上，大约三年后，他取来了大和国十市郡山寺中宾头卢前的一个烟熏得漆黑的钵，放在锦袋里，系在花枝上，带到辉夜姬家给她看。辉夜姬觉得奇怪，查看钵时，发现里面有一封信。打开看，上面写着：

                "海山路上耗尽心力，石钵中泪水流淌。"

                辉夜姬问："有光亮吗？"看了看，连萤火虫那么大的光亮都没有。

                "连露珠的光芒都无法容纳，你在小仓山上找什么呢？"

                她把钵退回去，皇子把钵扔在门口，回了一首诗：

                "白山相见时，光芒减弱了吗？虽然扔掉钵，但我仍然满怀希望。"

                写完后送了进去。辉夜姬没有回应，连听都不愿听，皇子恼怒地回去了。从他扔掉钵子再次说话开始，人们就把没有面子的事情称为"丢脸"。

                车持皇子是个心思灵巧的人，他对朝廷说："我要去筑紫国泡温泉。"请假后，对辉夜姬家里的人说："我要去取玉枝。"他下山时，应该服侍他的人们都送他到难波。皇子说："我想悄悄地去。"他没有带太多人，只带了几个亲近的人就出发了。送他的人们看着他离开后就回去了。人们以为"他走了"，但三天后他就划船回来了。由于事先都已经安排好了，他召集了当时最好的六位工匠，建造了一个普通人无法进入的房子，设置了三重警戒，把工匠们关在里面，皇子自己也一起住在那里，按照他的吩咐，打开了十六个炉子，制作玉枝。他们按照辉夜姬所说的样子，一丝不差地做出来了。他们非常巧妙地把它秘密地带到难波。"坐船回来了"，他这样向宫殿报告，装作非常疲惫的样子。有很多人来迎接他。玉枝被放在一个长箱子里，盖着东西带来。不知道从哪里传出消息："车持皇子带着优昙华花回来了。"这消息很快传开了。辉夜姬听到后想："我可能会输给这个皇子了。"她感到非常不安。就在这时，有人敲门说："车持皇子来了。"有人通报："皇子还穿着旅行的服装。"她去见他。皇子说："我不顾生命危险取回了玉枝，请把它给辉夜姬看。"翁把它拿进去。这玉枝上附有一封信：

                "虽然我徒劳无功，但若不亲手折下玉枝，决不会回来。"

                看到这些，竹取翁跑进来说："这位皇子已经按照你的要求带来了蓬莱山的玉枝，而且一点瑕疵都没有，完全符合要求。他甚至没有先回自己家，就直接穿着旅行的衣服来了。请你快点嫁给这位皇子吧。"但辉夜姬只是撑着脸颊，一副十分悲伤的样子。皇子说："现在已经没什么好说的了。"说着，他爬上了外廊。翁觉得这很合理："这确实是在这个国家看不到的玉枝。这次她肯定无法推辞了。这个人的身份也很好。"他这样想着。辉夜姬说："我不忍心拒绝父亲的话，所以才提出要这么难得的物品，但没想到他这么快就带来了。"她感到很不悦。翁开始准备新房。翁对皇子说："这棵树是在哪里找到的呢？真是奇怪、美丽又令人赞叹的东西。"皇子回答说："前年二月十日左右，我从难波乘船出海，不知道要去哪里，但我想：'如果不能实现自己的愿望，活在这个世界上还有什么意义？'所以我就随风漂流。'如果命中注定要死，那又能怎样呢？只要我还活着，我就会这样航行，也许能遇到所谓的蓬莱山。'我在波浪中漂流，环绕着我们的国家航行。有时候波浪汹涌，几乎沉入海底；有时候被风吹到陌生的国家，遇到像鬼一样的生物想要杀我；有时候不知道来时的路和去处，几乎迷失在海中；有时候食物用尽，只能以草根为食；有时候可怕的生物来袭击我；有时候我捕捉海贝维持生命。在旅途中没有人能帮助我，我得了各种病，迷失方向，任船只漂流，在海中漂泊了五百天。在辰时左右，远远地看到海中有一座山。我定睛望去，海上漂浮着一座非常大的山。那座山高耸美丽。我想：'这可能就是我寻找的山吧。'但还是感到畏惧，所以我绕着山航行了两三天，看到一个打扮得像天人的女子从山中走出来，用银制的水罐汲水。看到这一幕，我从船上下来，问她：'这座山叫什么名字？'女子回答说：'这是蓬莱山。'听到这个，我非常高兴。我问那个女子：'你是谁？'她说：'我的名字是宝冠瑠璃。'说完就突然进入山中消失了。我观察那座山，发现根本无法攀登。绕着山的周围，有许多在世界上看不到的花木。有金银瑠璃色的水流出，上面架着各种宝石做的桥。周围有闪闪发光的树木。我带回来的这一枝其实是比较差的，但我想：'如果不按照她说的做，就不行了。'所以我折了这枝花带回来。那座山美得无与伦比，虽然无法形容，但折下这枝花后，我就慌忙地回到船上，顺风航行，四百多天后才回来。也许是因为我虔诚的祈愿，昨天才从难波回到京都。我甚至没有换下被海水浸湿的衣服就赶来了。"听了这些，翁叹息地吟诵道：

                "就像苇竹年年生长，我只看到了山野中悲伤的节点。"

                皇子听到这首诗，说："这些日子以来我一直在苦恼，但今天终于可以放心了。"他回应道：

                "今天我的袖子已经干了，悲伤的数量也可以被忘记了。"

                就在这时，六个男子连在一起来到庭院。其中一个男子把文件夹在胳膊下说道："作物所的工匠汉部内麻吕报告：'制作玉树耗费了心力，花了一千多天的辛劳。但还没有得到报酬。请给予报酬分给大家。'"说着，他把文件递了上来。竹取翁问："这些工匠说的是什么事？"他侧着身子坐着。皇子脸色苍白，魂不守舍。辉夜姬听到这事后说："把那个文件拿来。"她看了看，上面写道："皇子殿下与卑微的工匠们一起隐居了一千多天，让我们制作精美的玉枝，并承诺会给我们官职。我们最近意识到，这是为了给辉夜姬求婚，所以希望能从宫中得到赏赐。"听到这些，辉夜姬心中的忧愁一扫而空，她叫来翁说："我还以为这真的是蓬莱山的树枝呢，没想到是这样卑劣的谎言，请让他赶快回去吧。"翁回答："既然确定是做出来的，让他回去也很容易。"他点点头。辉夜姬心满意足地写了一首回诗：

                "我听说是真的，仔细一看，原来只是装饰着言语的玉枝。"

                她把玉枝也退回去了。竹取翁刚才还在聊天，现在却觉得困了，睡着了。皇子坐立不安，天黑了就离开了。辉夜姬叫来那些工匠们，说："你们真是可爱的人。"给了他们丰厚的赏赐。工匠们非常高兴，说："事情如我们所愿了。"但在回去的路上，车持皇子让他们流血，把他们得到的赏赐全部夺走，他们只好逃走了。这样，这位皇子想："这辈子最大的耻辱莫过于此了。不仅没能得到女子，而且还让天下人耻笑。"于是他独自进入深山。官吏们分头寻找他，但不知他是否已经死去，没能找到他。这就是"稀有"一词的由来，意指皇子为了陪伴而消失不见的情况。

                右大臣阿倍御主人是一个财富丰厚、家业广阔的人。那年有一艘唐船到来，上面有个叫王卿的人，阿倍御主人写信给他说："请买一件火鼠裘送来。"他从手下人中选了一个可靠的人，叫小野房守，派他去送信。到达那个港口后，他给了王卿金钱。王卿打开信看了看，回复如下："火鼠裘在我国是没有的。我只是听说过，但从未见过。如果世上有的话，我们国家肯定也会有。这是非常难得的交易。但如果偶然从天竺运来，或者在某个大户人家能找到，我会设法买下；如果没有，我会派使者把金钱退还给你。"这艘唐船回来了。小野房守前来报告说，他正在回京都的路上。听到这个消息，阿倍御主人派人骑着快马去迎接他。骑马的人从筑紫只用了七天就回到京都。阿倍御主人看信上说："经过艰难的寻找，终于找到了火鼠裘。无论在现在还是过去，这种皮毛都非常稀有。听说以前有位聪明的天竺高僧把它带到了我们国家，据说在西山的寺庙里，我向公家请示后，好不容易买下来了。因为你给的金钱太少，所以我自己添了一些钱买下的。请再给我五十两金。等下一艘船回去的时候再送来。如果不给金钱，就请把裘皮退还作为质押。"看到这些，阿倍御主人说："你怎么看？多一点金钱不算什么。这确实是必须要送的东西。真高兴他送来了。"说着，他朝着唐土的方向俯身叩拜。他看了看装裘皮的盒子，发现是用各种美丽的琉璃装饰制成的。裘皮的颜色是蓝色的，毛尖闪烁着金色的光芒。确实看起来像是珍宝，其美丽无与伦比。不仅因为它不会被火烧，而且其清洁度也是无与伦比的。"难怪辉夜姬这么想要它。"他这么想着，说道："真是太好了。"他把裘皮放回盒子里，系在树枝上，打扮得非常疲惫的样子，好像就要在那里过夜一样，还附上了一首诗：

                "在无尽的相思中不会被烧毁的火鼠裘，今天衣袖已干，终于可以穿上了。"

                他来到辉夜姬家的门前。竹取翁出来接过东西，给辉夜姬看。辉夜姬看着那件裘皮说："看起来是很美丽的皮毛。但不知道是不是真的。"竹取翁回答说："不管怎样，先请他进来吧。这是世上少有的裘皮，请相信这是真的。不要让人受苦。"他邀请阿倍大臣进来。这样邀请他入座后，老婆婆心想："这次一定能成功。"这个翁一直为辉夜姬单身而忧心，想"让她嫁给一个好人"，但她坚决拒绝，他也无可奈何。辉夜姬对翁说："我觉得这件裘皮如果放在火上不被烧毁，那就是真的，我就会相信别人说的话。'因为是世上没有的东西，就会毫不怀疑地相信它是真的。'我还是要把它烧一下看看。"翁说："那也有道理。"他告诉大臣："她是这么说的。"大臣回答说："这件皮毛在唐土都是没有的，是经过千辛万苦寻找得到的。有什么好怀疑的呢？既然她这么说，那就烧一下看看吧。"他们把裘皮放在火中，但它燃烧起来了。"原来不是什么特别的皮毛啊。"大臣看到这一幕，脸色变得像草叶一样绿。辉夜姬则高兴地说："太好了。"她把大臣的诗放回盒子里，回了一首诗：

                "如果知道它会完全烧掉，就不会把火鼠裘放在心外了。"

                大臣只好回去了。世人都问："阿倍大臣带着火鼠裘来了，辉夜姬嫁给他了吗？她现在在哪里？"有人说："裘皮被放在火里完全烧掉了，辉夜姬没有嫁给他。"听到这个，人们开始用"烧尽"来形容无用的东西。

                大伴御行大纳言召集家中所有的人说："龙头上有发出五色光芒的宝珠。谁能给我取来，我就满足他的愿望。"男子们听到命令后说："您的命令非常尊贵。不过，这个宝珠不容易拿到，更何况是龙头上的宝珠，怎么能取得到呢？"大纳言说："自称是主君的使者的人，应该会想'就算牺牲性命也要完成主君的命令'。这不是在外国，不是在天竺唐土的东西，龙经常从我国的海山出入，你们怎么能说这是难事呢？"男子们说："那该怎么办呢？虽然很难，但遵照您的命令，我们会去寻找。"大纳言笑着说："你们已经自称是主君的使者了。怎么能违背主君的命令呢？"说着，他派他们去取龙头上的宝珠。这些人的路费和食物，他把宫中所有的丝绸、棉花、钱等都拿出来给他们。他还对这些人说："在你们回来之前，我会禁欲。如果不能取得这个宝珠，就不要回来。"听到这个命令，他们各自往自己脚下的方向走去。人们议论纷纷，说他在做傻事。他们把得到的东西分了，有的人躲在自己家里，有的人去了想去的地方。"即使是父亲、主君，也不该下达这样不合理的命令。"因为事情不顺利，他们诋毁大纳言。"如果要娶辉夜姬，这样做不好看。"大纳言这么想着，他建造了一座华丽的房子，涂上漆，装饰得美轮美奂，屋顶用染色的丝线覆盖，室内装饰用说不出的美丽绘画和织物。原来的妻子们都被遣散，他想："一定要娶到辉夜姬。"为此做了准备，独自度日。他派出去的人日夜都在等待，但过了一年也没有消息，感到不安，于是他非常隐秘地只带了两个侍从，化装前往难波，询问："有没有看到大伴大纳言的人乘船杀死龙，取得它头上的宝珠？"船夫回答说："真是怪事。"他们笑着说："没有做过这种事的船。"听到这个回答，他想："真是没胆量的船夫啊。不知道还这样说。""我弓的力量，如果有龙的话，就能立刻射死它，取得它头上的宝珠。不用等那些迟迟不归的家伙了。"他乘上船，在各个海域航行，最后到了筑紫方向的海域。不知道发生了什么，突然狂风大作，天地变得昏暗，把船吹得到处乱转。不知道是哪个方向，船被吹进了海中，眼看就要沉没，风把船吹得团团转，波浪不断拍打着船，仿佛要将其吞没，闪电像是要坠落下来一般闪烁着。大纳言惊慌失措地说："我从未见过如此可怕的情景。这将会怎样呢？"舵手回答说："我常年乘船航行，但从未见过如此可怕的情景。您的船要么沉入海底，要么被天雷击中。如果幸运的话，有神明相助，我们可能会被吹到南海。真是遗憾啊，为一位这样任性的主人服务，竟要面临这样毫无意义的死亡。"说着，舵手哭了起来。大纳言听到这些说："乘船时，舵手说的话就像高山一样可靠。为什么你说这些不可靠的话呢？"他吐着青沫说道。舵手回答说："我不是神明，能做什么呢？虽然风大浪急，但看起来天雷要落下来了，这是因为您想杀龙取宝珠，所以才会这样。这一定是龙在吹气。快向神明祈祷吧。"大纳言说："这是个好主意。"于是说："舵手之神请听着。我无知幼稚，想要杀龙。从现在开始，我绝不会动它一根毫毛。"他诚心祈祷，站着哭泣，大约祈祷了千次，渐渐地雷声停止了。天空稍微明亮一些，但风仍然猛烈地吹着。舵手说："这是龙的作为。这风是好的风，不是坏的风。它正朝着好的方向吹。"但大纳言没有听进去。三四天后，风把船吹回来了。他们看到岸边，原来是播磨的明石海岸。大纳言原以为自己被吹到了南海，现在终于松了一口气，躺了下来。船上的人向当地报告后，当地的官员来看望他，但他无法起身，只能躺在船底。他们在松树林里铺上席子，把他抬下船。这时他才意识到"原来不是南海"，他勉强站起来，但看起来被风吹得很厉害，肚子肿胀，两边的眼睛像挂着两个李子。看到这个样子，当地的官员也忍不住微笑。他下令制作一个轿子，被慢慢地抬回家去。不知怎么的，他派出去的那些人听说了此事，前来禀报说："因为无法取得龙头宝珠，所以未能回到宫中。我们以为您知道取珠有多难，不会责罚我们，所以现在回来了。"大纳言站起来说："你们做得很好。龙是雷神的同类。如果想取它的宝珠，可能会伤害很多人。更何况如果我捕获了龙，我自己也会受到伤害。幸好没能捕获它。那个名叫辉夜姬的大盗贼，是想害死人的。从今以后，我连她家附近都不会经过。你们也不要去那里。"他把家里还剩下的东西全部给了那些没有去取龙珠的人。听到这个消息，被他抛弃的原配夫人们捧腹大笑。他用染色丝线盖的房子，都被老鹰和乌鸦衔走做巢了。世人说："大伴大纳言是不是取到了龙珠？""不，不是，他在两眼上加了像李子一样的珠子回来了。"从此，人们开始用"啊，可怕"来形容不符合预期的事情。

                中纳言石上麻吕对家中的人说："如果燕子筑巢，就告诉我。"他们接受命令后问："这是为了什么呢？"他回答说："是为了取燕子所带的子安贝。"他们回答说："即使杀了很多燕子看，它们腹中也没有这种东西。不过，它们生产时可能会排出来，但即使人看到了，它们也会迅速藏起来。"另一个人说："大炊寮的煮饭房的屋顶上每个洞里都有燕子筑巢。如果派些可靠的人去那里，搭建脚手架监视，总会有燕子生产的。然后我们就能拿到它。"中纳言很高兴地说："多么有趣的事情啊！我以前竟然不知道。你提出了一个很好的建议。"他派了大约二十个可靠的人，让他们搭建脚手架在那里等待。宫中不断有使者来问："取到子安贝了吗？""因为有很多人爬上来，燕子害怕，不回巢。"报告了这样的回复。听到这些，中纳言感到为难，这时那个寮的官员，一位名叫仓津麻吕的老人说："如果您想取子安贝，我有个办法。"他来到中纳言面前，中纳言恭敬地迎接他。仓津麻吕说："取燕子的子安贝，您的方法不好。这样是拿不到的。因为脚手架太显眼，二十个人在上面，燕子受到惊吓，不会回来。应该怎么做呢，应该拆掉脚手架，让所有人退下，只留一个可靠的人放在粗竹笼子里，系上绳子，在燕子生产的时候把笼子拉上去，迅速取得子安贝。"中纳言说："这是个很好的主意。"他拆掉了脚手架，让所有人都回去了。中纳言对仓津麻吕说："怎么知道燕子什么时候生产，好派人上去呢？"仓津麻吕回答说："据说燕子生产时，会竖起尾巴转七圈，然后下蛋。当它转了七圈后，就拉上去，那时就能拿到子安贝。"中纳言很高兴，他不让任何人知道这件事，秘密地去了寮，混在男子们中间，日夜不停地监视，希望能拿到子安贝。听了仓津麻吕的建议，他非常高兴，说："在这里服务的人中竟然有这样的智慧，能帮我实现愿望，真是太高兴了。"他脱下自己的衣服赏给了仓津麻吕，还说："今晚务必来这个寮。"天黑后，他去那个寮看，果然燕子筑了巢。按照仓津麻吕说的，当看到燕子竖起尾巴转圈时，他让人把放在竹笼里的人拉上去，伸手到燕子窝里摸索，但那人说："什么也没有。"中纳言生气地说："你没有好好找。"他生气地说："谁比我更可靠？我自己爬上去找。"他坐进笼子里，被拉上去窥视，刚好看到燕子竖起尾巴快速转圈，他抬起手伸进去摸索，当手触摸到什么东西时，他说："我抓到东西了。快放我下来吧。老人说对了。"大家聚集起来说："快放他下来。"他们用力拉绳子，绳子断了，他直接仰面摔在围着火的三脚架上。众人惊讶不已，跑过去把他抱起来。他的眼睛向上翻着躺在那里。人们往他嘴里舀水。他勉强呼吸了一下，他们又从三脚架上把他的手脚拉下来。有人小心翼翼地问："您感觉怎么样？"他气若游丝地说："我身体有点感觉，但腰动不了。不过，我紧紧抓住了子安贝，这让我很高兴。先拿火来吧，我要看看这个贝壳长什么样。"他抬起头，张开手，原来他抓的是燕子残留的旧粪便。看到这个，他说："多么无益的事啊！"从此，人们开始用"无益"来形容与期望相反的事情。"这不是有益的事。"看到这一幕，他感到不舒服，无法被放进唐柜子，他的腰折断了。中纳言做了这样幼稚的事，他不想让人知道他生病了，但因为这个病，他变得非常虚弱。比起没能取得贝壳，他更担心人们的嘲笑，日益增长的羞耻感比生病死去更让他难以忍受。辉夜姬听说后，送了一首慰问诗：

                "多年来都没有波浪靠近的住吉松树，听说无益，是真的吗？"

                他虽然很虚弱，但仍抬起头，让人拿来纸，在痛苦中勉强写道：

                "既然贝壳是这样的东西，我在绝望中死去，难道你不能救我的命吗？"

                写完后，他就咽气了。听到这个消息，辉夜姬感到有些悲伤。从此，人们开始用"有益"来形容令人高兴的事情。

                天皇听说辉夜姬容貌非凡美丽，对内侍中臣的房子说："那个让许多人徒劳无功的辉夜姬，到底是个什么样的女子。去看看，然后回来报告。"房子领命前往。她到了竹取家后，被恭敬地请进去，与老婆婆相见。内侍对老婆婆说："我是奉命前来的，听说辉夜姬容貌非凡，我要好好看看，然后回去报告。"老婆婆说："那我去通报。"她进去后，对辉夜姬说："请赶快会见那位使者。"辉夜姬回答："我长得不漂亮，怎么能见人呢？"老婆婆说："你说什么呢？怎么能怠慢天皇的使者呢？"辉夜姬回答："即使是天皇的召见，我也不觉得有什么可怕的。"她说得如此羞涩又疏远，老婆婆也无法强迫她。老婆婆回到内侍那里说："抱歉，这个年轻人非常害怕，不愿意见面。"内侍说："'一定要见到她然后回去报告'，这是我的命令。如果不见到她，我怎么能回去呢？活在世上的人怎么能不服从国王的命令呢？请不要说这些不合理的话。"她说得很严厉，听到这些，辉夜姬更加不愿意出来见人。她说："如果不服从国王的命令，就杀了我吧。"内侍回去后，把这件事禀告给天皇。天皇听后说："这个女子心狠手辣，已经杀死了那么多人。"虽然他暂时放弃了，但仍然对她念念不忘，想："也许是这个女子的计谋使我败下阵来。"于是他召见了竹取翁，说："把你养的辉夜姬献上来。我听说她容貌美丽，派了使者去，但不得成功。难道就这样任性地教养她吗？"翁恭敬地回答："这个女子绝对不适合宫廷服务，我为此感到困扰。但我会回去把您的旨意告诉她。"听到这些，天皇说："为什么翁亲手养大的人，不能听从他的心意呢？如果这个女子被献上，翁怎么能不被授予官冠呢？"翁高兴地回家，对辉夜姬说："陛下是这样说的。你真的不去服侍吗？"辉夜姬回答："我从来就没有想过要去宫中服务。如果强迫我去，我就会消失。给您官职冠冕又有什么用呢？"翁回答说："不要这样。有了官职冠冕，如果不能见到我的女儿，又有什么用呢？既然如此，为什么不去宫中服务呢？你怎么会死呢？""你以为这是谎言吗？让我去服务，看看我会不会死。许多人向我求婚都被拒绝了，如果现在又顺从天皇的命令，对其他人也太不公平了。"翁回答说："你说得有道理。即使天下万事如此这般，最大的障碍是你生命的危险。我还是去禀报你不愿服侍的事。"于是他去禀报："尽管您的命令非常神圣，但当我让那个孩子服侍时，她说'如果让我去宫中服务，我就会死。'她不是我亲生的孩子，是我在山中发现的。所以她的性情与常人不同。"天皇说："竹取家靠近山脚吧。我假装去打猎，顺道去看看她吧。"竹取翁说："这是个好主意。她一定不会有防备，您可以突然造访看看她。"天皇立即定下日期，以打猎为名出行，进入辉夜姬的家。他看到一个光彩照人的女子坐在那里。"应该就是她了。"他走近她，但她逃进屋内，天皇抓住她的袖子，她虽然掩面，但他已经看到了她的容貌，觉得她美丽无比，决定"不会放过她。"他想带她回宫，但辉夜姬说："如果我是出生在这个国家的人，我会服侍您，但恐怕很难把我带走。"天皇说："怎么会这样呢？我还是要带你走。"他让轿子靠近，但辉夜姬突然变成了影子。"真遗憾啊。"他想，"她确实不是普通人。"于是说："那我不强迫你跟我走了。请恢复原来的样子吧。我看看你的样子再走。"听到这个，辉夜姬恢复了原来的样子。天皇更加爱慕她，无法抑制自己的感情。他很感谢让他看到她的竹取翁。主人竹取翁恭敬地招待宫中官员。天皇虽然想留下辉夜姬再走，但觉得可惜又遗憾，不过还是带着对她的思念回宫了。在轿子里，他写了一首诗：

                "回程的雪路感到厌倦，因那拒绝停留的辉夜姬。"

                辉夜姬的回复是：

                "生活在杂草丛生之下多年的我，为何要看那珍贵的宫殿呢？"

                天皇看到这首诗，更加不想回去了。他的心完全不想离开，但也不能整夜留在那里，所以只好回宫了。看到平常服侍自己的人，他们与辉夜姬相比简直无法相提并论。他原先觉得那些人"比其他人更美丽"，但与辉夜姬相比，他们简直算不上是人。他心中只有辉夜姬，只牵挂着她一个人。他不再随意访问其他妃子，只是写信给辉夜姬。她的回信虽然有些冷淡，但还是有回应，每当看到美丽的花草，他都会吟诗给她。

                就这样，他们互相慰藉心灵，大约过了三年，从春天开始，辉夜姬每当看到明亮的月亮，就比平时更加忧郁。虽然有人劝她"看月亮的脸是不吉利的"，但她时常在某个房间里看月亮，然后痛哭。到了七月十五日的满月时，她出来看着月亮，显得非常忧郁。服侍她的人告诉竹取翁说："辉夜姬一直都喜欢感叹月亮，但最近似乎情况不一般。她看起来非常悲伤。请您多加注意。"翁听到后对辉夜姬说："你怎么了？为什么看着月亮时如此忧伤呢？真是令人不安。"辉夜姬说："看到月亮，我就感到世界孤独凄凉。我有什么好悲伤的呢？"来到辉夜姬所在的地方，翁看到她仍然一脸忧郁。看到这个，他说："我的佛啊，你在想什么？你在想什么事情？"她回答："没什么特别的事。只是感到有些孤独。"翁说："不要看月亮。每次你看月亮时，就会显得忧郁。"她回答："我怎么可能不看月亮呢？"当月亮升起时，她仍然出去坐着，沉思悲叹。在黄昏时分，她看起来不那么忧郁。到了月亮出现的时候，她偶尔会叹息哭泣。服侍她的人说："她一定有心事。"但包括她的父母在内，没有人知道是什么事。到了八月十五日左右的月亮，辉夜姬出去坐着，大哭起来。现在她不再掩饰，当众哭泣。看到这一幕，她的父母问："怎么了？"辉夜姬边哭边说："我本想早点告诉你们，但担心会让你们心烦意乱，所以一直拖到现在。我想'应该不会吧'，但现在不得不说了。我不是这个国家的人，是月亮都的人。由于过去的因缘，我来到这个世界。现在是该回去的时候了，这个月十五日，我原来国家的人会来接我。无论如何我都要离开了，想到你们会为此悲伤，我从今年春天起就一直在悲伤着。"说着，她放声大哭。翁说："你在说什么啊？虽然是从竹子里发现的，但你当时只有芥菜籽那么大，我把你养到和我一样高，怎么可能让别人把我的孩子接走呢？我绝不允许。"他说："我宁愿去死。"他大声哭泣，看起来难以忍受。辉夜姬说："我是月亮都的人，那里有我的父母。虽然只是暂时来到这个国家，但我已经在这里生活了这么多年。我已经记不起那个国家的父母了。我在这里生活了这么久，已经习惯了。我不觉得那里有多好，只感到悲伤。但我不得不离开，这不是我自己的意愿。"她和翁一起痛哭。服侍她的人们已经相处多年，想到要分别，想到她那优雅美丽的风度，感到难以忍受，甚至无法进食，大家都一同悲伤着。天皇听说了这件事，派使者到竹取家。竹取翁出来迎接使者，哭得不能自已。因为这件事的悲伤，他的头发变白了，腰也弯了，眼睛也红肿了。翁今年才五十岁左右，但因为忧思，"在这短时间内就变老了。"使者带来天皇的问候："听说你非常忧郁，是真的吗？"竹取翁边哭边回答："在这个月，月亮都的人要来接辉夜姬。感谢您的关心。这个月请派些人来，当月亮都的人来时，抓住他们。"使者回去后，禀报了翁的情况和他说的话。天皇听后说："即使只是见过一面，也无法忘记，何况是天天相见习惯了的辉夜姬，怎能放她走呢？"到了十五日，他下令派少将高野大国为勅使，集合六卫的官员，派两千人到竹取家。他们到达后，在围墙上安排了一千人，在屋顶上安排了一千人，再加上家里的许多人，连一个缝隙都没有留下。这些守卫的人都带着弓箭。在主屋内，女眷们轮流守卫。老婆婆抱着辉夜姬坐在涂漆的笼子里。翁也拉上笼子的门坐在门口。翁说："有这么多人守卫，就算是天上的人也不可能赢过我们。"他对屋顶上的人说："如果有什么东西从天而降，就立刻射杀。"守卫的人说："在这样严密的守卫下，即使是一只蝙蝠，我们也会先射杀它，不让它逃出去。"翁听了这些，感到安心。辉夜姬听到后说："即使你们锁门守卫，准备战斗，也无法与那个国家的人对抗。用弓箭是射不到他们的。即使这样严密地封锁，那个国家的人来了，这些都会无效。即使想要对抗，那个国家的人来了，恐怕没有人会有勇气与他们战斗。"翁说："如果有人来接你，我要用长爪抓瞎他们的眼睛。拽着他们的头发扔下去。拉出他们的屁股，让这里的官员们看看，让他们丢脸。"他气愤地说。辉夜姬说："别大声说话。屋顶上的人会听到的。我对你们的关心一无所知，就要离开，真是遗憾。我想'可能缘分不深，很快就要离开了'，这让我感到悲伤。没能好好报答父母的养育之恩，离开后的路也不会平安，这几个月我一直想出去，请求再给我一年的时间，但没有得到允许，所以我一直在悲伤。扰乱了你们的心情就要离开，这让我感到悲伤难忍。那个都的人非常美丽，永远不会变老。他们没有烦恼。去那样的地方也并不是那么糟糕。但看不到你们渐渐变老的样子，我会很思念你们。"说着，她哭了起来。翁说："别说这些让人心痛的话。我不会伤害那些美丽的使者的。"他还是感到嫉妒。就在这时，夜已经过半，大约到了子时，整个房子周围比白天还要明亮。比十个满月还要明亮，连人的毛孔都看得清楚。从天空中，有人乘着云降下来，停在离地面约五尺高的地方，一排排站着。看到这一幕，里外的人都像是被某种东西吓到了，失去了战斗的勇气。他们勉强拿起弓箭，但手上没有力气，身体弯曲，虽然有些聪明的人想要射击，但箭却飞向了外面，那些人也不战斗，所有人都感到心神不定，无法好好守卫。站着的那些人，服装清洁得无与伦比。他们带着一辆飞车，撑着罗盖。其中一个看起来像王的人说："竹取，出来吧。"原本气势汹汹的竹取翁也像喝醉了一样，趴在地上。那人说："那个小小的人，因为翁有一点功德，所以作为他的助力，我们暂时让你下凡，但你在那里待了那么多年，得到那么多金钱，好像已经换了个人似的。辉夜姬因为犯了罪，所以才会被暂时送到你这样卑微的人那里。现在她的罪已经结束了，所以我们来接她，翁却哭泣悲伤，这是做不到的事。快把她交出来。"翁回答："我养育辉夜姬已有二十余年。您说是暂时的，这让我感到奇怪。也许是另外一个叫辉夜姬的人吧。我家的辉夜姬正患重病，无法出来。"但对方没有回答，而是把飞车停在屋顶上说："来吧，辉夜姬，你怎么能在这污秽的地方待这么久呢？"被封锁的房间的门立刻自动打开了。格子们也无人触碰就打开了。老婆婆抱着的辉夜姬走了出来。无法阻止，老婆婆只能仰望着哭泣。

                竹取翁心神恍惚，趴在地上哭泣。辉夜姬走到他身边说："我不是自愿离开的，请至少看着我升天吧。"但他说："为什么要看这悲伤的一幕呢？你抛弃我升天，是什么意思？带上我一起去吧。"他哭着趴下，她感到心烦意乱。"我写封信再走吧。当你想念我的时候，拿出来看看吧。"她流着泪写道："如果我生在这个国家，就能陪伴你们到不让你们悲伤的程度，但我不能这样离开，感到非常遗憾。我留下的衣服请作为纪念。当月亮升起的夜晚，请望着它。从天上看着你们离去，我感觉自己要从天上掉下来了。"天人中有人拿着一个盒子，里面装着天之羽衣。另一个盒子里装着不死之药。一个天人说："请给她这壶药。因为她在肮脏的地方吃了东西，可能会感到不适。"说着，把药拿过来，她尝了一点，想留一些作为纪念，包在她脱下的衣服里，但一个天人不让她这样做，拿出天衣想给她穿上。

                这时辉夜姬说："稍等一下。"她接着说，"穿上这件衣服的人会变得心如止水。我还有一句话要说。"她写了一封信。天人等得不耐烦了，说："太慢了。"辉夜姬说："不要说这些无知的话。"她非常平静地写着给天皇的信。态度毫不慌张。"虽然您派了这么多人来留住我，但不可抗拒的迎接者已经来了，要带我离开，这让我感到非常遗憾。我没能侍奉宫廷，是因为我本身就有这样的命运，虽然您可能不理解，但我强硬地没有接受您的邀请，您一定认为我是个冷漠的人，这一直让我耿耿于怀。"她写道：

                "现在我要穿上天之羽衣了，这时候我才想起对您的怀念。"

                她附上了那壶药，叫来头中将交给他。头中将接过后，天人们立刻给她穿上了天衣。穿上这件衣服后，她对翁的怜悯和悲伤之情也消失了。穿上这件衣服的人不再有世俗的牵挂，于是她乘上车，与大约一百名天人一起升天了。

                此后，翁与老婆婆流着血泪悲伤，但也无济于事。他们读了她留下的信，但翁说："命还有什么好留恋的呢？为了谁我还要继续生活呢？"他不吃药，卧病不起。头中将带着众人回去，禀报无法战胜留住辉夜姬的事情。他呈上装有药的壶和辉夜姬的信。天皇展开看后，感到非常悲伤，不愿进食，也不举行任何娱乐活动。他召集大臣和高官们，问："哪座山最接近天空？"有人回答："骏河国的山最接近京都和天空。"听到这个，天皇写道：

                "即使相会也只是在眼泪中浮现，对于我这样的身份，不死的药又有什么用呢？"

                他把不死之药的壶和信一起交给使者。他召见了调岩笠，命令他把东西带到骏河国的山顶上。他告诉他在山顶上应该怎么做（原文如此）。他命令把信和不死之药的壶并排放置，然后点火烧掉。使者领命后，带着许多士兵登上山，从此那座山被称为富士山。据说那烟至今仍在升向云中。`,
